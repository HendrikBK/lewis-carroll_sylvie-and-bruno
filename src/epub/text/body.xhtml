<h2 class="eee">PREFACE.</h2>
<p>One little picture in this book, the Magic Locket,
at <a href="#Page_77">p. 77</a>, was drawn by ‘Miss Alice Havers.’ I did
not state this on the title-page, since it seemed only
due, to the artist of all these (to my mind) <i>wonderful</i>
pictures, that his name should stand there alone.</p>
<p class="tb">The descriptions, at pp. <a href="#Page_386">386</a>, <a href="#Page_387">387</a>, of Sunday as
spent by children of the last generation, are quoted
<i>verbatim</i> from a speech made to me by a child-friend
and a letter written to me by a lady-friend.</p>
<p class="tb">The Chapters, headed ‘Fairy Sylvie’ and ‘Bruno’s
Revenge,’ are a reprint, with a few alterations, of a
little fairy-tale which I wrote in the year 1867, at the
request of the late Mrs. Gatty, for ‘Aunt Judy’s
Magazine,’ which she was then editing.</p>
<p>It was in 1874, I believe, that the idea first occurred
to me of making it the nucleus of a longer story. As
the years went on, I jotted down, at odd moments,
all sorts of odd ideas, and fragments of dialogue, that
occurred to me—who knows how?—with a transitory
suddenness that left me no choice but either
to record them then and there, or to abandon them
to oblivion. Sometimes one could trace to their
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
source these random flashes of thought—as being
suggested by the book one was reading, or struck
out from the ‘flint’ of one’s own mind by the ‘steel’
of a friend’s chance remark—but they had also a
way of their own, of occurring, <i>à propos</i> of nothing—specimens
of that hopelessly illogical phenomenon,
‘an effect without a cause.’ Such, for example, was
the last line of ‘The Hunting of the Snark,’ which
came into my head (as I have already related in
‘The Theatre’ for April, 1887) quite suddenly, during
a solitary walk: and such, again, have been passages
which occurred in <i>dreams</i>, and which I cannot trace
to any antecedent cause whatever. There are at
least <i>two</i> instances of such dream-suggestions in
this book—one, my Lady’s remark, ‘it often runs
in families, just as a love for pastry does’, at <a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>;
the other, Eric Lindon’s <i>badinage</i> about having been
in domestic service, at <a href="#Page_332">p. 332</a>.</p>
<p>And thus it came to pass that I found myself at
last in possession of a huge unwieldy mass of litterature—if
the reader will kindly excuse the spelling—which
only needed stringing together, upon the
thread of a consecutive story, to constitute the book
I hoped to write. Only! The task, at first, seemed
absolutely hopeless, and gave me a far clearer idea,
than I ever had before, of the meaning of the word
‘chaos’: and I think it must have been ten years, or
more, before I had succeeded in classifying these
odds-and-ends sufficiently to see what sort of a story
they indicated: for the story had to grow out of the
incidents, not the incidents out of the story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</div>
<p>I am telling all this, in no spirit of egoism, but
because I really believe that some of my readers will
be interested in these details of the ‘genesis’ of a
book, which looks so simple and straight-forward a
matter, when completed, that they might suppose it
to have been written straight off, page by page,
as one would write a letter, beginning at the beginning
and ending at the end.</p>
<p>It is, no doubt, <i>possible</i> to write a story in that
way: and, if it be not vanity to say so, I believe
that I could, myself,—if I were in the unfortunate
position (for I do hold it to be a real misfortune) of
being obliged to produce a given amount of fiction
in a given time,—that I could ‘fulfil my task,’ and
produce my ‘tale of bricks,’ as other slaves have
done. One thing, at any rate, I could guarantee as
to the story so produced—that it should be utterly
commonplace, should contain no new ideas whatever,
and should be very very weary reading!</p>
<p>This species of literature has received the very
appropriate name of ‘padding’—which might fitly
be defined as ‘that which all can write and none can
read.’ That the present volume contains <i>no</i> such
writing I dare not avow: sometimes, in order to
bring a picture into its proper place, it has been
necessary to eke out a page with two or three extra
lines: but I can honestly say I have put in no more
than I was absolutely compelled to do.</p>
<p>My readers may perhaps like to amuse themselves
by trying to detect, in a given passage, the one piece
of ‘padding’ it contains. While arranging the ‘slips’
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
into pages, I found that the passage, which now extends
from the top of <a href="#Page_35">p. 35</a> to the middle of <a href="#Page_38">p. 38</a>, was
3 lines too short. I supplied the deficiency, not by
interpolating a word here and a word there, but by
writing in 3 consecutive lines. Now can my readers
guess <i>which</i> they are?</p>
<p>A harder puzzle—if a harder be desired—would
be to determine, as to the Gardener’s Song, in <i>which</i>
cases (if any) the stanza was adapted to the surrounding
text, and in <i>which</i> (if any) the text was adapted
to the stanza.</p>
<p class="tb">Perhaps the hardest thing in all literature—at
least <i>I</i> have found it so: by no voluntary effort can
I accomplish it: I have to take it as it comes—is
to write anything <i>original</i>. And perhaps the easiest
is, when once an original line has been struck out, to
follow it up, and to write any amount more to the
same tune. I do not know if ‘Alice in Wonderland’
was an <i>original</i> story—I was, at least, no <i>conscious</i>
imitator in writing it—but I do know that, since it
came out, something like a dozen story-books have
appeared, on identically the same pattern. The path
I timidly explored—believing myself to be ‘the first
that ever burst into that silent sea’—is now a beaten
high-road: all the way-side flowers have long ago
been trampled into the dust: and it would be courting
disaster for me to attempt that style again.</p>
<p>Hence it is that, in ‘Sylvie and Bruno,’ I have
striven—with I know not what success—to strike
out yet another new path: be it bad or good, it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
the best I can do. It is written, not for money, and
not for fame, but in the hope of supplying, for the
children whom I love, some thoughts that may suit
those hours of innocent merriment which are the very
life of Childhood; and also in the hope of suggesting,
to them and to others, some thoughts that may
prove, I would fain hope, not wholly out of harmony
with the graver cadences of Life.</p>
<p class="tb">If I have not already exhausted the patience of
my readers, I would like to seize this opportunity—perhaps
the last I shall have of addressing so many
friends at once—of putting on record some ideas
that have occurred to me, as to books desirable to
be written—which I should much like to <i>attempt</i>,
but may not ever have the time or power to carry
through—in the hope that, if <i>I</i> should fail (and the
years are gliding away <i>very</i> fast) to finish the task
I have set myself, other hands may take it up.</p>
<p class="tb">First, a Child’s Bible. The only real <i>essentials</i> of
this would be, carefully selected passages, suitable for
a child’s reading, and pictures. One principle of selection,
which I would adopt, would be that Religion
should be put before a child as a revelation of <i>love</i>—no need
to pain and puzzle the young mind with
the history of crime and punishment. (On such a
principle I should, for example, omit the history of
the Flood.) The supplying of the pictures would
involve no great difficulty: no new ones would be
needed: hundreds of excellent pictures already exist,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
the copyright of which has long ago expired, and
which simply need photo-zincography, or some similar
process, for their successful reproduction. The book
should be handy in size—with a pretty attractive-looking
cover—in a clear legible type—and, above
all, with abundance of pictures, pictures, pictures!</p>
<p class="tb">Secondly, a book of pieces selected from the Bible—not
single texts, but passages of from 10 to 20
verses each—to be committed to memory. Such
passages would be found useful, to repeat to one’s-self
and to ponder over, on many occasions when
reading is difficult, if not impossible: for instance,
when lying awake at night—on a railway-journey—when
taking a solitary walk—in old age, when
eye-sight is failing or wholly lost—and, best of all,
when illness, while incapacitating us for reading or
any other occupation, condemns us to lie awake
through many weary silent hours: at such a time
how keenly one may realise the truth of David’s
rapturous cry ‘<i>O how sweet are thy words unto my
throat: yea, sweeter than honey unto my mouth!</i>’</p>
<p>I have said ‘passages,’ rather than single texts,
because we have no means of <i>recalling</i> single texts:
memory needs <i>links</i>, and here are none: one may
have a hundred texts stored in the memory, and not
be able to recall, at will, more than half-a-dozen—and
those by mere chance: whereas, once get hold of
any portion of a <i>chapter</i> that has been committed to
memory, and the whole can be recovered: all hangs
together.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_xv">xv</div>
<p class="tb">Thirdly, a collection of passages, both prose and
verse, from books other than the Bible. There is not
perhaps much, in what is called ‘un-inspired’ literature
(a misnomer, I hold: if Shakespeare was not
inspired, one may well doubt if any man ever was),
that will bear the process of being pondered over, a
hundred times: still there <i>are</i> such passages—enough,
I think, to make a goodly store for the memory.</p>
<p>These two books—of sacred, and secular, passages
for memory—will serve other good purposes besides
merely occupying vacant hours: they will help to keep
at bay many anxious thoughts, worrying thoughts,
uncharitable thoughts, unholy thoughts. Let me say
this, in better words than my own, by copying a
passage from that most interesting book, Robertson’s
Lectures on the Epistles to the Corinthians, Lecture
<span class="small">XLIX</span>. “If a man finds himself haunted by evil
desires and unholy images, which will generally be at
periodical hours, let him commit to memory passages
of Scripture, or passages from the best writers in verse
or prose. Let him store his mind with these, as safe-guards
to repeat when he lies awake in some restless
night, or when despairing imaginations, or gloomy,
suicidal thoughts, beset him. Let these be to him the
sword, turning everywhere to keep the way of the
Garden of Life from the intrusion of profaner
footsteps.”</p>
<p class="tb">Fourthly, a “Shakespeare” for girls: that is, an
edition in which everything, not suitable for the perusal
of girls of (say) from 10 to 17, should be omitted. Few
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
children under 10 would be likely to understand or
enjoy the greatest of poets: and those, who have
passed out of girlhood, may safely be left to read
Shakespeare, in any edition, ‘expurgated’ or not, that
they may prefer: but it seems a pity that so many
children, in the intermediate stage, should be debarred
from a great pleasure for want of an edition suitable
to them. Neither Bowdler’s, Chambers’s, Brandram’s,
nor Cundell’s ‘Boudoir’ Shakespeare, seems to me to
meet the want: they are not sufficiently ‘expurgated.’
Bowdler’s is the most extraordinary of all: looking
through it, I am filled with a deep sense of wonder,
considering what he has left in, that he should have
cut <i>anything</i> out! Besides relentlessly erasing all
that is unsuitable on the score of reverence or decency,
I should be inclined to omit also all that seems too
difficult, or not likely to interest young readers. The
resulting book might be slightly fragmentary: but it
would be a real treasure to all British maidens who
have any taste for poetry.</p>
<p class="tb">If it be needful to apologize to any one for the
new departure I have taken in this story—by introducing,
along with what will, I hope, prove to be
acceptable nonsense for children, some of the graver
thoughts of human life—it must be to one who
has learned the Art of keeping such thoughts wholly
at a distance in hours of mirth and careless ease. To
him such a mixture will seem, no doubt, ill-judged
and repulsive. And that such an Art <i>exists</i> I do not
dispute: with youth, good health, and sufficient money,
<span class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
it seems quite possible to lead, for years together, a
life of unmixed gaiety—with the exception of one
solemn fact, with which we are liable to be confronted
at <i>any</i> moment, even in the midst of the most brilliant
company or the most sparkling entertainment. A
man may fix his own times for admitting serious
thought, for attending public worship, for prayer, for
reading the Bible: all such matters he can defer to
that ‘convenient season’, which is so apt never to
occur at all: but he cannot defer, for one single
moment, the necessity of attending to a message,
which may come before he has finished reading this
page, ‘<i>this night shall thy soul be required of thee</i>.’</p>
<p>The ever-present sense of this grim possibility has
been, in all ages,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a>
an incubus that men have striven
to shake off. Few more interesting subjects of enquiry
could be found, by a student of history, than
the various weapons that have been used against this
shadowy foe. Saddest of all must have been the
thoughts of those who saw indeed an <i>existence</i> beyond
the grave, but an existence far more terrible than
annihilation—an existence as filmy, impalpable, all
but invisible spectres, drifting about, through endless
ages, in a world of shadows, with nothing to do, nothing
to hope for, nothing to love! In the midst of the
gay verses of that genial ‘bon vivant’ Horace, there
stands one dreary word whose utter sadness goes to
<span class="pb" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
one’s heart. It is the word ‘<i>exilium</i>’ in the well-known
passage</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium</p>
<p class="t0">Versatur urnâ serius ocius</p>
<p class="t">Sors exitura et nos in æternum</p>
<p class="t2">Exilium impositura cymbæ.</p>
</div>
<p>Yes, to him this present life—spite of all its
weariness and all its sorrow—was the only life worth
having: all else was ‘exile’! Does it not seem almost
incredible that one, holding such a creed, should ever
have smiled?</p>
<p>And many in this day, I fear, even though believing
in an existence beyond the grave far more real than
Horace ever dreamed of, yet regard it as a sort of
‘exile’ from all the joys of life, and so adopt Horace’s
theory, and say ‘let us eat and drink, for to-morrow
we die.’</p>
<p>We go to entertainments, such as the theatre—I
say ‘we’, for <i>I</i> also go to the play, whenever I get a
chance of seeing a really good one—and keep at arm’s
length, if possible, the thought that we may not return
alive. Yet how do you know—dear friend, whose
patience has carried you through this garrulous preface—that
it may not be <i>your</i> lot, when mirth is fastest
and most furious, to feel the sharp pang, or the deadly
faintness, which heralds the final crisis—to see, with
vague wonder, anxious friends bending over you—to
hear their troubled whispers—perhaps yourself to
shape the question, with trembling lips, “Is it
<span class="pb" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
serious?”, and to be told “Yes: the end is near”
(and oh, how different all Life will look when those
words are said!)—how do you know, I say, that all
this may not happen to <i>you</i>, this night?</p>
<p>And <i>dare</i> you, knowing this, say to yourself “Well,
perhaps it <i>is</i> an immoral play: perhaps the situations
<i>are</i> a little too ‘risky’, the dialogue a little too strong,
the ‘business’ a little too suggestive. I don’t say
that conscience is <i>quite</i> easy: but the piece is so
clever, I must see it this once! I’ll begin a stricter
life to-morrow.” <i>To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow!</i></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Who sins in hope, who, sinning, says,</p>
<p class="t0">‘Sorrow for sin God’s judgement stays!’</p>
<p class="t0">Against God’s Spirit he lies; quite stops</p>
<p class="t0">Mercy with insult; dares, and drops,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a scorch’d fly, that spins in vain</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the axis of its pain,</p>
<p class="t0">Then takes its doom, to limp and crawl,</p>
<p class="t0">Blind and forgot, from fall to fall.”</p>
</div>
<p class="tb">Let me pause for a moment to say that I believe
this thought, of the possibility of death—if calmly
realised, and steadily faced—would be one of the
best possible tests as to our going to any scene of
amusement being right or wrong. If the thought of
sudden death acquires, for <i>you</i>, a special horror when
imagined as happening in a <i>theatre</i>, then be very
sure the theatre is harmful for <i>you</i>, however
harmless it may be for others; and that <i>you</i> are
<span class="pb" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
incurring a deadly peril in going. Be sure the
safest rule is that we should not dare to <i>live</i> in any
scene in which we dare not <i>die</i>.</p>
<p>But, once realise what the true object <i>is</i> in life—that
it is <i>not</i> pleasure, <i>not</i> knowledge, <i>not</i> even fame
itself, ‘that last infirmity of noble minds’—but
that it <i>is</i> the development of <i>character</i>, the rising to
a higher, nobler, purer standard, the building-up of
the perfect <i>Man</i>—and then, so long as we feel that
this is going on, and will (we trust) go on for evermore,
death has for us no terror; it is not a shadow,
but a light; not an end, but a beginning!</p>
<p class="tb">One other matter may perhaps seem to call for
apology—that I should have treated with such
entire want of sympathy the British passion for
‘Sport’, which no doubt has been in by-gone days,
and is still, in some forms of it, an excellent school
for hardihood and for coolness in moments of danger.
But I am not entirely without sympathy for <i>genuine</i>
‘Sport’: I can heartily admire the courage of the
man who, with severe bodily toil, and at the risk of
his life, hunts down some ‘man-eating’ tiger: and I
can heartily sympathize with him when he exults in the
glorious excitement of the chase and the hand-to-hand
struggle with the monster brought to bay. But
I can but look with deep wonder and sorrow on the
hunter who, at his ease and in safety, can find pleasure
in what involves, for some defenceless creature,
wild terror and a death of agony: deeper, if the
hunter be one who has pledged himself to preach
<span class="pb" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
to men the Religion of universal Love: deepest
of all, if it be one of those ‘<i>tender and delicate</i>’
beings, whose very name serves as a symbol of Love—‘<i>thy
love to me was wonderful, passing the love of
women</i>’—whose mission here is surely to help and
comfort all that are in pain or sorrow!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">‘Farewell, farewell! but this I tell</p>
<p class="t">To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!</p>
<p class="t0">He prayeth well, who loveth well</p>
<p class="t">Both man and bird and beast.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He prayeth best, who loveth best</p>
<p class="t">All things both great and small;</p>

</div>
<h1 title="">SYLVIE AND BRUNO.</h1>
<h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
<br /><span class="small">LESS BREAD! MORE TAXES!</span></h2>
<p>—and then all the people cheered again, and
one man, who was more excited than the rest,
flung his hat high into the air, and shouted (as
well as I could make out) “Who roar for the
Sub-Warden?” <i>Everybody</i> roared, but whether
it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not
clearly appear: some were shouting “Bread!”
and some “Taxes!”, but no one seemed to
know what it was they really wanted.</p>
<p>All this I saw from the open window of
the Warden’s breakfast-saloon, looking across
the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor, who had
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
sprung to his feet the moment the shouting
began, almost as if he had been expecting it,
and had rushed to the window which commanded
the best view of the market-place.</p>
<p>“What <i>can</i> it all mean?” he kept repeating
to himself, as, with his hands clasped behind
him, and his gown floating in the air, he paced
rapidly up and down the room. “I never
heard such shouting before—and at this time
of the morning, too! And with such unanimity!
Doesn’t it strike <i>you</i> as very remarkable?”</p>
<p>I represented, modestly, that to <i>my</i> ears it
appeared that they were shouting for different
things, but the Chancellor would not listen to
my suggestion for a moment. “They all shout
the same words, I assure you!” he said: then,
leaning well out of the window, he whispered
to a man who was standing close underneath,
“Keep ’em together, ca’n’t you? The Warden
will be here directly. Give ’em the signal for
the march up!” All this was evidently not
meant for <i>my</i> ears, but I could scarcely help
hearing it, considering that my chin was almost
on the Chancellor’s shoulder.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<div class="img" id="fig1">
<img src="images/i003.jpg" alt="THE MARCH-UP" width="500" height="593" />
<p class="center small">THE MARCH-UP</p>
</div>
<p>The ‘march up’ was a very curious sight:
a straggling procession of men, marching two
and two, began from the other side of the
market-place, and advanced in an irregular
zig-zag fashion towards the Palace, wildly tacking
from side to side, like a sailing vessel
making way against an unfavourable wind—so
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
that the head of the procession was often
further from us at the end of one tack than it
had been at the end of the previous one.</p>
<p>Yet it was evident that all was being done
under orders, for I noticed that all eyes were
fixed on the man who stood just under the
window, and to whom the Chancellor was continually
whispering. This man held his hat in
one hand and a little green flag in the other:
whenever he waved the flag the procession
advanced a little nearer, when he dipped it they
sidled a little farther off, and whenever he
waved his hat they all raised a hoarse cheer.
“Hoo-roah!” they cried, carefully keeping time
with the hat as it bobbed up and down.
“Hoo-roah! Noo! Consti! Tooshun! Less!
Bread! More! Taxes!”</p>
<p>“That’ll do, that’ll do!” the Chancellor
whispered. “Let ’em rest a bit till I give you
the word. He’s not here yet!” But at this
moment the great folding-doors of the saloon
were flung open, and he turned with a guilty
start to receive His High Excellency. However
it was only Bruno, and the Chancellor
gave a little gasp of relieved anxiety.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>“Morning!” said the little fellow, addressing
the remark, in a general sort of way, to the
Chancellor and the waiters. “Doos oo know
where Sylvie is? I’s looking for Sylvie!”</p>
<p>“She’s with the Warden, I believe, y’reince!”
the Chancellor replied with a low bow. There
was, no doubt, a certain amount of absurdity in
applying this title (which, as of course you see
without my telling you, was nothing but ‘your
Royal Highness’ condensed into one syllable)
to a small creature whose father was merely the
Warden of Outland: still, large excuse must
be made for a man who had passed several
years at the Court of Fairyland, and had there
acquired the almost impossible art of pronouncing
five syllables as one.</p>
<p>But the bow was lost upon Bruno, who had
run out of the room, even while the great feat
of The Unpronounceable Monosyllable was
being triumphantly performed.</p>
<p>Just then, a single voice in the distance was
understood to shout “A speech from the
Chancellor!” “Certainly, my friends!” the Chancellor
replied with extraordinary promptitude.
“You shall have a speech!” Here one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
waiters, who had been for some minutes busy
making a queer-looking mixture of egg and
sherry, respectfully presented it on a large
silver salver. The Chancellor took it haughtily,
drank it off thoughtfully, smiled benevolently
on the happy waiter as he set down the empty
glass, and began. To the best of my recollection
this is what he said.</p>
<p>“Ahem! Ahem! Ahem! Fellow-sufferers, or
rather suffering fellows——” (“Don’t call ’em
names!” muttered the man under the window.
“I didn’t say <i>felons</i>!” the Chancellor
explained.) “You may be sure that I always
sympa——” (“’Ear, ’ear!” shouted the crowd,
so loudly as quite to drown the orator’s thin
squeaky voice) “—that I always sympa——”
he repeated. (“Don’t simper quite so much!”
said the man under the window. “It makes
yer look a hidiot!” And, all this time, “’Ear,
’ear!” went rumbling round the market-place,
like a peal of thunder.) “That I always <i>sympathise</i>!”
yelled the Chancellor, the first moment
there was silence. “But your <i>true</i> friend
is the <i>Sub-Warden</i>! Day and night he is
brooding on your wrongs—I should say your
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
<i>rights</i>—that is to say your <i>wrongs</i>—no, I
mean your <i>rights</i>——” (“Don’t talk no more!”
growled the man under the window. “You’re
making a mess of it!”) At this moment the
Sub-Warden entered the saloon. He was a
thin man, with a mean and crafty face, and a
greenish-yellow complexion; and he crossed the
room very slowly, looking suspiciously about
him as if he thought there might be a savage
dog hidden somewhere. “Bravo!” he cried,
patting the Chancellor on the back. “You did
that speech very well indeed. Why, you’re a
born orator, man!”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nothing!” the Chancellor replied,
modestly, with downcast eyes. “Most orators
are <i>born</i>, you know.”</p>
<p>The Sub-Warden thoughtfully rubbed his
chin. “Why, so they are!” he admitted. “I
never considered it in that light. Still, you
did it very well. A word in your ear!”</p>
<p>The rest of their conversation was all in
whispers: so, as I could hear no more, I
thought I would go and find Bruno.</p>
<p>I found the little fellow standing in the
passage, and being addressed by one of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
men in livery, who stood before him, nearly
bent double from extreme respectfulness, with
his hands hanging in front of him like the fins
of a fish. “His High Excellency,” this respectful
man was saying, “is in his Study,
y’reince!” (He didn’t pronounce this quite
so well as the Chancellor.) Thither Bruno
trotted, and I thought it well to follow him.</p>
<p>The Warden, a tall dignified man with a
grave but very pleasant face, was seated before
a writing-table, which was covered with papers,
and holding on his knee one of the sweetest and
loveliest little maidens it has ever been my lot
to see. She looked four or five years older
than Bruno, but she had the same rosy cheeks
and sparkling eyes, and the same wealth of
curly brown hair. Her eager smiling face was
turned upwards towards her father’s, and it
was a pretty sight to see the mutual love with
which the two faces—one in the Spring of
Life, the other in its late Autumn—were
gazing on each other.</p>
<p>“No, you’ve never seen him,” the old man
was saying: “you couldn’t, you know, he’s
been away so long—traveling from land to
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
land, and seeking for health, more years than
you’ve been alive, little Sylvie!”</p>
<p>Here Bruno climbed upon his other knee, and
a good deal of kissing, on a rather complicated
system, was the result.</p>
<p>“He only came back last night,” said the
Warden, when the kissing was over: “he’s
been traveling post-haste, for the last thousand
miles or so, in order to be here on Sylvie’s
birthday. But he’s a very early riser, and I
dare say he’s in the Library already. Come
with me and see him. He’s always kind to
children. You’ll be sure to like him.”</p>
<p>“Has the Other Professor come too?”
Bruno asked in an awe-struck voice.</p>
<p>“Yes, they arrived together. The Other
Professor is—well, you won’t like him quite
so much, perhaps. He’s a little more <i>dreamy</i>,
you know.”</p>
<p>“I wiss <i>Sylvie</i> was a little more dreamy,”
said Bruno.</p>
<p>“What <i>do</i> you mean, Bruno?” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>Bruno went on addressing his father. “She
says she <i>ca’n’t</i>, oo know. But I thinks it isn’t
<i>ca’n’t</i>, it’s <i>wo’n’t</i>.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
<p>“Says she <i>ca’n’t</i> dream!” the puzzled
Warden repeated.</p>
<p>“She <i>do</i> say it,” Bruno persisted. “When
I says to her ‘Let’s stop lessons!’, she says
‘Oh, I ca’n’t <i>dream</i> of letting oo stop yet!’”</p>
<p>“He always wants to stop lessons,” Sylvie
explained, “five minutes after we begin!”</p>
<p>“Five minutes’ lessons a day!” said the
Warden. “You won’t learn much at <i>that</i>
rate, little man!”</p>
<p>“That’s just what Sylvie says,” Bruno rejoined.
“She says I <i>wo’n’t</i> learn my lessons.
And I tells her, over and over, I <i>ca’n’t</i> learn
’em. And what doos oo think she says? She
says ‘It isn’t <i>ca’n’t</i>, it’s <i>wo’n’t</i>!’”</p>
<p>“Let’s go and see the Professor,” the Warden
said, wisely avoiding further discussion. The
children got down off his knees, each secured
a hand, and the happy trio set off for the
Library—followed by me. I had come to the
conclusion by this time that none of the party
(except, for a few moments, the Lord Chancellor)
was in the least able to see me.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter with him?” Sylvie asked,
walking with a little extra sedateness, by way
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
of example to Bruno at the other side, who
never ceased jumping up and down.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<p class="center small">VISITING THE PROFESSOR</p>
</div>
<p>“What <i>was</i> the matter—but I hope he’s all
right now—was lumbago, and rheumatism, and
that kind of thing. He’s been curing <i>himself</i>,
you know: he’s a very learned doctor. Why,
he’s actually <i>invented</i> three new diseases, besides
a new way of breaking your collar-bone!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>“Is it a nice way?” said Bruno.</p>
<p>“Well, hum, not <i>very</i>,” the Warden said, as
we entered the Library. “And here <i>is</i> the
Professor. Good morning, Professor! Hope
you’re quite rested after your journey!”</p>
<p>A jolly-looking, fat little man, in a flowery
dressing-gown, with a large book under each
arm, came trotting in at the other end of the
room, and was going straight across without
taking any notice of the children. “I’m looking
for Vol. Three,” he said. “Do you happen
to have seen it?”</p>
<p>“You don’t see my <i>children</i>, Professor!”
the Warden exclaimed, taking him by the
shoulders and turning him round to face them.</p>
<p>The Professor laughed violently: then he
gazed at them through his great spectacles, for
a minute or two, without speaking.</p>
<p>At last he addressed Bruno. “I hope you
have had a good night, my child?”</p>
<p>Bruno looked puzzled. “I’s had the same
night <i>oo’ve</i> had,” he replied. “There’s only
been <i>one</i> night since yesterday!”</p>
<p>It was the Professor’s turn to look puzzled
now. He took off his spectacles, and rubbed
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
them with his hankerchief. Then he gazed at
them again. Then he turned to the Warden.
“Are they bound?” he enquired.</p>
<p>“No, we aren’t,” said Bruno, who thought
himself quite able to answer <i>this</i> question.</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head sadly. “Not
even half-bound?”</p>
<p>“Why <i>would</i> we be half-bound?” said Bruno.
“We’re not prisoners!”</p>
<p>But the Professor had forgotten all about
them by this time, and was speaking to the
Warden again. “You’ll be glad to hear,” he
was saying, “that the Barometer’s beginning
to move——”</p>
<p>“Well, which way?” said the Warden—adding
to the children, “Not that <i>I</i> care, you
know. Only <i>he</i> thinks it affects the weather.
He’s a wonderfully clever man, you know.
Sometimes he says things that only the Other
Professor can understand. Sometimes he says
things that <i>nobody</i> can understand! Which
way is it, Professor? Up or down?”</p>
<p>“Neither!” said the Professor, gently clapping
his hands. “It’s going sideways—if I
may so express myself.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>“And what kind of weather does <i>that</i> produce?”
said the Warden. “Listen, children!
Now you’ll hear something worth knowing!”</p>
<p>“Horizontal weather,” said the Professor,
and made straight for the door, very nearly
trampling on Bruno, who had only just time to
get out of his way.</p>
<p>“<i>Isn’t</i> he learned?” the Warden said, looking
after him with admiring eyes. “Positively
he runs over with learning!”</p>
<p>“But he needn’t run over <i>me</i>!” said Bruno.</p>
<p>The Professor was back in a moment: he had
changed his dressing-gown for a frock-coat,
and had put on a pair of very strange-looking
boots, the tops of which were open umbrellas.
“I thought you’d like to see them,” he said.
“<i>These</i> are the boots for horizontal weather!”</p>
<p>“But what’s the use of wearing umbrellas
round one’s knees?”</p>
<p>“In <i>ordinary</i> rain,” the Professor admitted,
“they would <i>not</i> be of much use. But if ever
it rained <i>horizontally</i>, you know, they would
be invaluable—simply invaluable!”</p>
<p>“Take the Professor to the breakfast-saloon,
children,” said the Warden. “And tell them
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
not to wait for me. I had breakfast early, as
I’ve some business to attend to.” The children
seized the Professor’s hands, as familiarly as if
they had known him for years, and hurried him
away. I followed respectfully behind.</p>

<h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
<br /><span class="small">L’AMIE INCONNUE.</span></h2>
<p>As we entered the breakfast-saloon, the Professor
was saying “—and he had breakfast
by himself, early: so he begged you wouldn’t
wait for him, my Lady. This way, my Lady,”
he added, “this way!” And then, with (as it
seemed to me) most superfluous politeness, he
flung open the door of my compartment, and
ushered in “—a young and lovely lady!” I
muttered to myself with some bitterness. “And
this is, of course, the opening scene of Vol. I.
<i>She</i> is the Heroine. And <i>I</i> am one of those
subordinate characters that only turn up when
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
needed for the development of her destiny, and
whose final appearance is outside the church,
waiting to greet the Happy Pair!”</p>
<p>“Yes, my Lady, change at Fayfield,” were
the next words I heard (oh that too obsequious
Guard!), “next station but one.” And the door
closed, and the lady settled down into her
corner, and the monotonous throb of the engine
(making one feel as if the train were some
gigantic monster, whose very circulation we
could feel) proclaimed that we were once more
speeding on our way. “The lady had a perfectly
formed nose,” I caught myself saying to
myself, “hazel eyes, and lips——” and here it
occurred to me that to see, for myself, what
“the lady” was really like, would be more
satisfactory than much speculation.</p>
<p>I looked round cautiously, and—was entirely
disappointed of my hope. The veil,
which shrouded her whole face, was too thick
for me to see more than the glitter of bright
eyes and the hazy outline of what <i>might</i> be a
lovely oval face, but might also, unfortunately,
be an equally <i>un</i>lovely one. I closed my eyes
again, saying to myself “—couldn’t have a
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
better chance for an experiment in Telepathy!
I’ll <i>think out</i> her face, and afterwards test the
portrait with the original.”</p>
<p>At first, no result at all crowned my efforts,
though I ‘divided my swift mind,’ now hither,
now thither, in a way that I felt sure would
have made Æneas green with envy: but the
dimly-seen oval remained as provokingly blank
as ever—a mere Ellipse, as if in some mathematical
diagram, without even the Foci that
might be made to do duty as a nose and a
mouth. Gradually, however, the conviction
came upon me that I could, by a certain concentration
of thought, <i>think the veil away</i>, and
so get a glimpse of the mysterious face—as
to which the two questions, “is she pretty?”
and “is she plain?”, still hung suspended, in
my mind, in beautiful equipoise.</p>
<p>Success was partial—and fitful—still there
<i>was</i> a result: ever and anon, the veil seemed
to vanish, in a sudden flash of light: but,
before I could fully realise the face, all was
dark again. In each such glimpse, the face
seemed to grow more childish and more innocent:
and, when I had at last <i>thought</i> the veil
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
entirely away, it was, unmistakeably, the sweet
face of little Sylvie!</p>
<p>“So, either I’ve been dreaming about Sylvie,”
I said to myself, “and this is the reality. Or
else I’ve really been with Sylvie, and this is a
dream! Is Life itself a dream, I wonder?”</p>
<p>To occupy the time, I got out the letter,
which had caused me to take this sudden railway-journey
from my London home down to a
strange fishing-town on the North coast, and
read it over again:—</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<span class="sc"><i>Dear old Friend</i></span>,</p>
<p>“<i>I’m sure it will be as great a pleasure
to me, as it can possibly be to you, to meet once
more after so many years: and of course I shall
be ready to give you all the benefit of such
medical skill as I have: only, you know, one
mustn’t violate professional etiquette! And
you are already in the hands of a first-rate
London doctor, with whom it would be utter
affectation for me to pretend to compete. (I
make no doubt he is right in saying the heart
is affected: all your symptoms point that way.)
One thing, at any rate, I have already done in
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
my doctorial capacity—secured you a bedroom
on the ground-floor, so that you will not need
to ascend the stairs at all.</i></p>
<p>“<i>I shall expect you by last train on Friday,
in accordance with your letter: and, till then,
I shall say, in the words of the old song, ‘Oh
for Friday nicht! Friday’s lang a-coming!’</i></p>
<p><span class="center">“<i>Yours always</i>,</span>
<span class="jr">“<span class="sc"><i>Arthur Forester</i></span>.</span></p>
<p>“<i>P.S. Do you believe in Fate?</i>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This Postscript puzzled me sorely. “He is
far too sensible a man,” I thought, “to have
become a Fatalist. And yet what else can he
mean by it?” And, as I folded up the letter
and put it away, I inadvertently repeated the
words aloud. “Do you believe in Fate?”</p>
<p>The fair ‘Incognita’ turned her head quickly
at the sudden question. “No, I don’t!” she
said with a smile. “Do you?”</p>
<p>“I—I didn’t mean to ask the question!” I
stammered, a little taken aback at having begun
a conversation in so unconventional a fashion.</p>
<p>The lady’s smile became a laugh—not a
mocking laugh, but the laugh of a happy child
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
who is perfectly at her ease. “Didn’t you?”
she said. “Then it was a case of what you
Doctors call ‘unconscious cerebration’?”</p>
<p>“I am no Doctor,” I replied. “Do I look
so like one? Or what makes you think it?”</p>
<p>She pointed to the book I had been reading,
which was so lying that its title, “Diseases of
the Heart,” was plainly visible.</p>
<p>“One needn’t be a <i>Doctor</i>,” I said, “to take
an interest in medical books. There’s another
class of readers, who are yet more deeply
interested——”</p>
<p>“You mean the <i>Patients</i>?” she interrupted,
while a look of tender pity gave new sweetness
to her face. “But,” with an evident wish to
avoid a possibly painful topic, “one needn’t be
<i>either</i>, to take an interest in books of <i>Science</i>.
Which contain the greatest amount of Science,
do you think, the books, or the minds?”</p>
<p>“Rather a profound question for a lady!” I
said to myself, holding, with the conceit so
natural to Man, that Woman’s intellect is essentially
shallow. And I considered a minute
before replying. “If you mean <i>living</i> minds,
I don’t think it’s possible to decide. There is
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
so much <i>written</i> Science that no living person
has ever <i>read</i>: and there is so much <i>thought-out</i>
Science that hasn’t yet been <i>written</i>. But,
if you mean the whole human race, then I
think the <i>minds</i> have it: everything, recorded
in <i>books</i>, must have once been in some <i>mind</i>,
you know.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that rather like one of the Rules in
Algebra?” my Lady enquired. (“<i>Algebra</i>
too!” I thought with increasing wonder.) “I
mean, if we consider thoughts as <i>factors</i>, may
we not say that the Least Common Multiple
of all the <i>minds</i> contains that of all the <i>books</i>;
but not the other way?”</p>
<p>“Certainly we may!” I replied, delighted
with the illustration. “And what a grand
thing it would be,” I went on dreamily, thinking
aloud rather than talking, “if we could
only <i>apply</i> that Rule to books! You know, in
finding the Least Common Multiple, we strike
out a quantity wherever it occurs, except in
the term where it is raised to its highest power.
So we should have to erase every recorded
thought, except in the sentence where it is
expressed with the greatest intensity.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>My Lady laughed merrily. “<i>Some</i> books
would be reduced to blank paper, I’m afraid!”
she said.</p>
<p>“They would. Most libraries would be
terribly diminished in <i>bulk</i>. But just think
what they would gain in <i>quality</i>!”</p>
<p>“When will it be done?” she eagerly asked.
“If there’s any chance of it in <i>my</i> time, I think
I’ll leave off reading, and wait for it!”</p>
<p>“Well, perhaps in another thousand years
or so——”</p>
<p>“Then there’s no use waiting!” said my
Lady. “Let’s sit down. Uggug, my pet,
come and sit by me!”</p>
<p>“Anywhere but by <i>me</i>!” growled the Sub-Warden.
“The little wretch always manages
to upset his coffee!”</p>
<p>I guessed at once (as perhaps the reader will
also have guessed, if, like myself, he is <i>very</i>
clever at drawing conclusions) that my Lady
was the Sub-Warden’s wife, and that Uggug
(a hideous fat boy, about the same age as
Sylvie, with the expression of a prize-pig) was
their son. Sylvie and Bruno, with the Lord
Chancellor, made up a party of seven.</p>

<p class="center small">A PORTABLE PLUNGE-BATH</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>“And you actually got a plunge-bath every
morning?” said the Sub-Warden, seemingly
in continuation of a conversation with the Professor.
“Even at the little roadside-inns?”</p>
<p>“Oh, certainly, certainly!” the Professor
replied with a smile on his jolly face. “Allow
me to explain. It is, in fact, a very simple
problem in Hydrodynamics. (That means a
combination of Water and Strength.) If we
take a plunge-bath, and a man of great strength
(such as myself) about to plunge into it, we
have a perfect example of this science. I am
bound to admit,” the Professor continued, in a
lower tone and with downcast eyes, “that we
need a man of <i>remarkable</i> strength. He must
be able to spring from the floor to about twice
his own height, gradually turning over as he
rises, so as to come down again head first.”</p>
<p>“Why, you need a <i>flea</i>, not a <i>man</i>!” exclaimed
the Sub-Warden.</p>
<p>“Pardon me,” said the Professor. “This
particular kind of bath is <i>not</i> adapted for a flea.
Let us suppose,” he continued, folding his
table-napkin into a graceful festoon, “that
this represents what is perhaps <i>the</i> necessity
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
of this Age—the Active Tourist’s Portable
Bath. You may describe it briefly, if you
like,” looking at the Chancellor, “by the
letters A. T. P. B.”</p>
<p>The Chancellor, much disconcerted at finding
everybody looking at him, could only murmur,
in a shy whisper, “Precisely so!”</p>
<p>“One great advantage of this plunge-bath,”
continued the Professor, “is that it requires
only half-a-gallon of water——”</p>
<p>“I don’t call it a <i>plunge</i>-bath,” His Sub-Excellency
remarked, “unless your Active
Tourist goes <i>right under</i>!”</p>
<p>“But he <i>does</i> go right under,” the old man
gently replied. “The A. T. hangs up the P. B.
on a nail—<i>thus</i>. He then empties the water-jug
into it—places the empty jug below the
bag—leaps into the air—descends head-first
into the bag—the water rises round him to the
top of the bag—and there you are!” he triumphantly
concluded. “The A. T. is as much
under water as if he’d gone a mile or two down
into the Atlantic!”</p>
<p>“And he’s drowned, let us say, in about four
minutes——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>“By no means!” the Professor answered
with a proud smile. “After about a minute,
he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the
P. B.—all the water runs back into the jug—and
there you are again!”</p>
<p>“But how in the world is he to get <i>out</i> of
the bag again?”</p>
<p>“<i>That</i>, I take it,” said the Professor, “is the
most beautiful part of the whole invention. All
the way up the P. B., inside, are loops for the
thumbs; so it’s something like going up-stairs,
only perhaps less comfortable; and, by the time
the A. T. has risen out of the bag, all but his
head, he’s sure to topple over, one way or
the other—the Law of Gravity secures <i>that</i>.
And there he is on the floor again!”</p>
<p>“A little bruised, perhaps?”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, a little bruised; but <i>having had
his plunge-bath</i>: that’s the great thing.”</p>
<p>“Wonderful! It’s almost beyond belief!”
murmured the Sub-Warden. The Professor
took it as a compliment, and bowed with a
gratified smile.</p>
<p>“<i>Quite</i> beyond belief!” my Lady added—meaning,
no doubt, to be more complimentary
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
still. The Professor bowed, but he didn’t smile
<i>this</i> time.</p>
<p>“I can assure you,” he said earnestly, “that,
<i>provided the bath was made</i>, I used it every
morning. I certainly <i>ordered</i> it—<i>that</i> I am
clear about—my only doubt is, whether the
man ever finished making it. It’s difficult to
remember, after so many years——”</p>
<p>At this moment the door, very slowly and
creakingly, began to open, and Sylvie and
Bruno jumped up, and ran to meet the well-known
footstep.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
<br /><span class="small">BIRTHDAY-PRESENTS.</span></h2>
<p>“It’s my brother!” the Sub-Warden exclaimed,
in a warning whisper. “Speak out,
and be quick about it!”</p>
<p>The appeal was evidently addressed to the
Lord Chancellor, who instantly replied, in a
shrill monotone, like a little boy repeating the
alphabet, “As I was remarking, your Sub-Excellency,
this portentous movement——”</p>
<p>“You began too soon!” the other interrupted,
scarcely able to restrain himself to a
whisper, so great was his excitement. “He
couldn’t have heard you. Begin again!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>“As I was remarking,” chanted the obedient
Lord Chancellor, “this portentous movement
has already assumed the dimensions of a
Revolution!”</p>
<p>“And what <i>are</i> the dimensions of a
Revolution?” The voice was genial and
mellow, and the face of the tall dignified old
man, who had just entered the room, leading
Sylvie by the hand, and with Bruno riding
triumphantly on his shoulder, was too noble
and gentle to have scared a less guilty man:
but the Lord Chancellor turned pale instantly,
and could hardly articulate the words “The
dimensions—your—your High Excellency?
I—I—scarcely comprehend!”</p>
<p>“Well, the length, breadth, and thickness, if
you like it better!” And the old man smiled,
half-contemptuously.</p>
<p>The Lord Chancellor recovered himself with
a great effort, and pointed to the open window.
“If your High Excellency will listen for a
moment to the shouts of the exasperated
populace——” (“of the exasperated populace!”
the Sub-Warden repeated in a louder
tone, as the Lord Chancellor, being in a state
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
of abject terror, had dropped almost into a
whisper)“—you will understand what it is
they want.”</p>
<p>And at that moment there surged into the
room a hoarse confused cry, in which the
only clearly audible words were “Less—bread—More—taxes!”
The old man laughed
heartily. “What in the world——” he was
beginning: but the Chancellor heard him not.
“Some mistake!” he muttered, hurrying to
the window, from which he shortly returned
with an air of relief. “<i>Now</i> listen!” he
exclaimed, holding up his hand impressively.
And now the words came quite distinctly, and
with the regularity of the ticking of a clock,
“More—bread—Less—taxes!”</p>
<p>“More bread!” the Warden repeated in
astonishment. “Why, the new Government
Bakery was opened only last week, and I
gave orders to sell the bread at cost-price
during the present scarcity! What <i>can</i> they
expect more?”</p>
<p>“The Bakery’s closed, y’reince!” the
Chancellor said, more loudly and clearly than
he had spoken yet. He was emboldened by
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
the consciousness that <i>here</i>, at least, he had
evidence to produce: and he placed in the
Warden’s hands a few printed notices, that
were lying ready, with some open ledgers, on
a side-table.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, <i>I</i> see!” the Warden muttered,
glancing carelessly through them. “Order
countermanded by my brother, and supposed
to be <i>my</i> doing! Rather sharp practice!
It’s all right!” he added in a louder tone.
“My name is signed to it: so I take it on
myself. But what do they mean by ‘Less
Taxes’? How <i>can</i> they be less? I abolished
the last of them a month ago!”</p>
<p>“It’s been put on again, y’reince, and by
y’reince’s own orders!”, and other printed
notices were submitted for inspection.</p>
<p>The Warden, whilst looking them over,
glanced once or twice at the Sub-Warden,
who had seated himself before one of the open
ledgers, and was quite absorbed in adding it
up; but he merely repeated “It’s all right.
I accept it as my doing.”</p>
<p>“And they do say,” the Chancellor went on
sheepishly—looking much more like a convicted
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
thief than an Officer of State, “that a
change of Government, by the abolition of the
Sub-Warden—I mean,” he hastily added, on
seeing the Warden’s look of astonishment, “the
abolition of the <i>office</i> of Sub-Warden, and
giving the present holder the right to act as
<i>Vice</i>-Warden whenever the Warden is absent—would
appease all this seedling discontent.
I mean,” he added, glancing at a paper he held
in his hand, “all this <i>seething</i> discontent!”</p>
<p>“For fifteen years,” put in a deep but very
harsh voice, “my husband has been acting as
Sub-Warden. It is too long! It is much too
long!” My Lady was a vast creature at all
times: but, when she frowned and folded her
arms, as now, she looked more gigantic than
ever, and made one try to fancy what a
haystack would look like, if out of temper.</p>
<p>“He would distinguish himself as a Vice!”
my Lady proceeded, being far too stupid to
see the double meaning of her words. “There
has been no such Vice in Outland for many a
long year, as he would be!”</p>
<p>“What course would <i>you</i> suggest, Sister?”
the Warden mildly enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>My Lady stamped, which was undignified:
and snorted, which was ungraceful. “This is
no <i>jesting</i> matter!” she bellowed.</p>
<p>“I will consult my brother,” said the
Warden. “Brother!”</p>
<p>“—and seven makes a hundred and
ninety-four, which is sixteen and twopence,”
the Sub-Warden replied. “Put down two and
carry sixteen.”</p>
<p>The Chancellor raised his hands and eyebrows,
lost in admiration. “<i>Such</i> a man of
business!” he murmured.</p>
<p>“Brother, could I have a word with you
in my Study?” the Warden said in a louder
tone. The Sub-Warden rose with alacrity,
and the two left the room together.</p>
<p>My Lady turned to the Professor, who
had uncovered the urn, and was taking its
temperature with his pocket-thermometer.
“Professor!” she began, so loudly and suddenly
that even Uggug, who had gone to
sleep in his chair, left off snoring and opened
one eye. The Professor pocketed his thermometer
in a moment, clasped his hands, and put
his head on one side with a meek smile.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>“You were teaching my son before breakfast,
I believe?” my Lady loftily remarked.
“I hope he strikes you as having talent?”</p>
<p>“Oh, very much so indeed, my Lady!” the
Professor hastily replied, unconsciously rubbing
his ear, while some painful recollection seemed
to cross his mind. “I was very forcibly struck
by His Magnificence, I assure you!”</p>
<p>“He is a charming boy!” my Lady exclaimed.
“Even his snores are more musical
than those of other boys!”</p>
<p>If that <i>were</i> so, the Professor seemed to
think, the snores of <i>other</i> boys must be
something too awful to be endured: but he
was a cautious man, and he said nothing.</p>
<p>“And he’s so clever!” my Lady continued.
“No one will enjoy your Lecture more—by
the way, have you fixed the time for it
yet? You’ve never given one, you know: and
it was promised years ago, before you——”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, my Lady, <i>I</i> know! Perhaps next
Tuesday—or Tuesday week——”</p>
<p>“That will do very well,” said my Lady,
graciously. “Of course you will let the Other
Professor lecture as well?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>“I think <i>not</i>, my Lady,” the Professor said
with some hesitation. “You see, he always
stands with his back to the audience. It does
very well for <i>reciting</i>; but for <i>lecturing</i>——”</p>
<p>“You are quite right,” said my Lady. “And,
now I come to think of it, there would hardly
be time for more than <i>one</i> Lecture. And it
will go off all the better, if we begin with a
Banquet, and a Fancy-dress Ball——”</p>
<p>“It will indeed!” the Professor cried, with
enthusiasm.</p>
<p>“I shall come as a Grass-hopper,” my Lady
calmly proceeded. “What shall <i>you</i> come as,
Professor?”</p>
<p>The Professor smiled feebly. “I shall come
as—as early as I can, my Lady!”</p>
<p>“You mustn’t come in before the doors are
opened,” said my Lady.</p>
<p>“I ca’n’t,” said the Professor. “Excuse me
a moment. As this is Lady Sylvie’s birthday,
I would like to——” and he rushed away.</p>
<p>Bruno began feeling in his pockets, looking
more and more melancholy as he did so: then
he put his thumb in his mouth, and considered
for a minute: then he quietly left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>He had hardly done so before the Professor
was back again, quite out of breath. “Wishing
you many happy returns of the day, my dear
child!” he went on, addressing the smiling
little girl, who had run to meet him. “Allow
me to give you a birthday-present. It’s a
second-hand pincushion, my dear. And it only
cost fourpence-halfpenny!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, it’s <i>very</i> pretty!” And Sylvie
rewarded the old man with a hearty kiss.</p>
<p>“And the <i>pins</i> they gave me for nothing!”
the Professor added in high glee. “Fifteen of
em, and only <i>one</i> bent!”</p>
<p>“I’ll make the bent one into a <i>hook</i>!” said
Sylvie. “To catch Bruno with, when he runs
away from his lessons!”</p>
<p>“You ca’n’t guess what <i>my</i> present is!” said
Uggug, who had taken the butter-dish from
the table, and was standing behind her, with a
wicked leer on his face.</p>
<p>“No, I ca’n’t guess,” Sylvie said without
looking up. She was still examining the Professor’s
pincushion.</p>
<p>“It’s <i>this</i>!” cried the bad boy, exultingly, as
he emptied the dish over her, and then, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
a grin of delight at his own cleverness, looked
round for applause.</p>
<p>Sylvie coloured crimson, as she shook off the
butter from her frock: but she kept her lips
tight shut, and walked away to the window,
where she stood looking out and trying to
recover her temper.</p>
<p>Uggug’s triumph was a very short one: the
Sub-Warden had returned, just in time to be
a witness of his dear child’s playfulness, and
in another moment a skilfully-applied box
on the ear had changed the grin of delight
into a howl of pain.</p>
<p>“My darling!” cried his mother, enfolding
him in her fat arms. “Did they box his ears
for nothing? A precious pet!”</p>
<p>“It’s not for <i>nothing</i>!” growled the angry
father. “Are you aware, Madam, that <i>I</i> pay
the house-bills, out of a fixed annual sum?
The loss of all that wasted butter falls on
<i>me</i>! Do you hear, Madam!”</p>
<p>“Hold your tongue, Sir!” My Lady spoke
very quietly—almost in a whisper. But there
was something in her <i>look</i> which silenced him.
“Don’t you see it was only a <i>joke</i>? And a
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
very clever one, too! He only meant that he
loved nobody <i>but</i> her! And, instead of being
pleased with the compliment, the spiteful little
thing has gone away in a huff!”</p>
<p>The Sub-Warden was a very good hand at
changing a subject. He walked across to the
window. “My dear,” he said, “is that a <i>pig</i>
that I see down below, rooting about among
your flower-beds?”</p>
<p>“A <i>pig</i>!” shrieked my Lady, rushing madly
to the window, and almost pushing her husband
out, in her anxiety to see for herself. “Whose
pig is it? How did it get in? Where’s that
crazy Gardener gone?”</p>
<p>At this moment Bruno re-entered the room,
and passing Uggug (who was blubbering his
loudest, in the hope of attracting notice) as if
he was quite used to that sort of thing, he ran
up to Sylvie and threw his arms round her.
“I went to my toy-cupboard,” he said with
a very sorrowful face, “to see if there were
<i>somefin</i> fit for a present for oo! And there
isn’t <i>nuffin</i>! They’s <i>all</i> broken, every one!
And I haven’t got <i>no</i> money left, to buy oo
a birthday-present! And I ca’n’t give oo
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
nuffin but <i>this</i>!” (“<i>This</i>” was a very earnest
hug and a kiss.)</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you, darling!” cried Sylvie. “I
like <i>your</i> present best of all!” (But if so,
why did she give it back so quickly?)</p>
<p>His Sub-Excellency turned and patted the
two children on the head with his long lean
hands. “Go away, dears!” he said. “There’s
business to talk over.”</p>
<p>Sylvie and Bruno went away hand in hand:
but, on reaching the door, Sylvie came back
again and went up to Uggug timidly. “I don’t
mind about the butter,” she said, “and I—I’m
sorry he hurt you!” And she tried to shake
hands with the little ruffian: but Uggug only
blubbered louder, and wouldn’t make friends.
Sylvie left the room with a sigh.</p>
<p>The Sub-Warden glared angrily at his weeping
son. “Leave the room, Sirrah!” he said,
as loud as he dared. His wife was still leaning
out of the window, and kept repeating “I <i>ca’n’t</i>
see that pig! Where <i>is</i> it?”</p>
<p>“It’s moved to the right—now it’s gone a
little to the left,” said the Sub-Warden: but
he had his back to the window, and was making
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
signals to the Lord Chancellor, pointing to
Uggug and the door, with many a cunning
nod and wink.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">
<img src="images/i041.jpg" alt="REMOVAL OF UGGUG" width="500" height="364" />
<p class="center small">REMOVAL OF UGGUG</p>
</div>
<p>The Chancellor caught his meaning at last,
and, crossing the room, took that interesting
child by the ear—the next moment he and
Uggug were out of the room, and the door shut
behind them: but not before one piercing yell
had rung through the room, and reached the
ears of the fond mother.</p>
<p>“What <i>is</i> that hideous noise?” she fiercely
asked, turning upon her startled husband.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>“It’s some hyæna—or other,” replied the
Sub-Warden, looking vaguely up to the ceiling,
as if that was where they usually were to be
found. “Let us to business, my dear. Here
comes the Warden.” And he picked up from
the floor a wandering scrap of manuscript, on
which I just caught the words ‘after which
Election duly holden the said Sibimet and
Tabikat his wife may at their pleasure assume
Imperial——’ before, with a guilty look, he
crumpled it up in his hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
<br /><span class="small">A CUNNING CONSPIRACY.</span></h2>
<p>The Warden entered at this moment: and
close behind him came the Lord Chancellor, a
little flushed and out of breath, and adjusting
his wig, which appeared to have been dragged
partly off his head.</p>
<p>“But where is my precious child?” my
Lady enquired, as the four took their seats at
the small side-table devoted to ledgers and
bundles and bills.</p>
<p>“He left the room a few minutes ago—with
the Lord Chancellor,” the Sub-Warden
briefly explained.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>“Ah!” said my Lady, graciously smiling on
that high official. “Your Lordship has a very
<i>taking</i> way with children! I doubt if any one
could <i>gain the ear</i> of my darling Uggug so
quickly as <i>you</i> can!” For an entirely stupid
woman, my Lady’s remarks were curiously full
of meaning, of which she herself was wholly
unconscious.</p>
<p>The Chancellor bowed, but with a very
uneasy air. “I think the Warden was about
to speak,” he remarked, evidently anxious to
change the subject.</p>
<p>But my Lady would not be checked. “He
is a clever boy,” she continued with enthusiasm,
“but he needs a man like your Lordship to
<i>draw him out</i>!”</p>
<p>The Chancellor bit his lip, and was silent.
He evidently feared that, stupid as she looked,
she understood what she said <i>this</i> time, and
was having a joke at his expense. He might
have spared himself all anxiety: whatever accidental
meaning her <i>words</i> might have, she
<i>herself</i> never meant anything at all.</p>
<p>“It is all settled!” the Warden announced,
wasting no time over preliminaries. “The
<span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
Sub-Wardenship is abolished, and my brother
is appointed to act as Vice-Warden whenever
I am absent. So, as I am going abroad for a
while, he will enter on his new duties at once.”</p>
<p>“And there will really be a Vice after all?”
my Lady enquired.</p>
<p>“I hope so!” the Warden smilingly replied.</p>
<p>My Lady looked much pleased, and tried
to clap her hands: but you might as well have
knocked two feather-beds together, for any
noise it made. “When my husband is Vice,”
she said, “it will be the same as if we had a
<i>hundred</i> Vices!”</p>
<p>“Hear, hear!” cried the Sub-Warden.</p>
<p>“You seem to think it very remarkable,” my
Lady remarked with some severity, “that your
wife should speak the truth!”</p>
<p>“No, not <i>remarkable</i> at all!” her husband
anxiously explained. “<i>Nothing</i> is remarkable
that <i>you</i> say, sweet one!”</p>
<p>My Lady smiled approval of the sentiment,
and went on. “And am I Vice-Wardeness?”</p>
<p>“If you choose to use that title,” said the
Warden: “but ‘Your Excellency’ will be the
proper style of address. And I trust that both
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
‘<i>His</i> Excellency’ and ‘<i>Her</i> Excellency’ will
observe the Agreement I have drawn up. The
provision I am <i>most</i> anxious about is this.”
He unrolled a large parchment scroll, and read
aloud the words “‘<i>item</i>, that we will be kind
to the poor.’ The Chancellor worded it for
me,” he added, glancing at that great Functionary.
“I suppose, now, that word ‘<i>item</i>’
has some deep legal meaning?”</p>
<p>“Undoubtedly!” replied the Chancellor, as
articulately as he could with a pen between
his lips. He was nervously rolling and unrolling
several other scrolls, and making room
among them for the one the Warden had just
handed to him. “These are merely the rough
copies,” he explained: “and, as soon as I have
put in the final corrections—” making a great
commotion among the different parchments,
“—a semi-colon or two that I have accidentally
omitted—” here he darted about, pen in hand,
from one part of the scroll to another, spreading
sheets of blotting-paper over his corrections,
“all will be ready for signing.”</p>
<p>“Should it not be read out, first?” my
Lady enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>“No need, no need!” the Sub-Warden and
the Chancellor exclaimed at the same moment,
with feverish eagerness.</p>
<p>“No need at all,” the Warden gently assented.
“Your husband and I have gone through it
together. It provides that he shall exercise
the full authority of Warden, and shall have
the disposal of the annual revenue attached to
the office, until my return, or, failing that, until
Bruno comes of age: and that he shall then
hand over, to myself or to Bruno as the case
may be, the Wardenship, the unspent revenue,
and the contents of the Treasury, which are to
be preserved, intact, under his guardianship.”</p>
<p>All this time the Sub-Warden was busy,
with the Chancellor’s help, shifting the papers
from side to side, and pointing out to the
Warden the place where he was to sign. He
then signed it himself, and my Lady and the
Chancellor added their names as witnesses.</p>
<p>“Short partings are best,” said the Warden.
“All is ready for my journey. My children
are waiting below to see me off.” He gravely
kissed my Lady, shook hands with his brother
and the Chancellor, and left the room.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<div class="img" id="fig6">
<img src="images/i048.jpg" alt="‘WHAT A GAME!’" width="500" height="326" />
<p class="center small">‘WHAT A GAME!’</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The three waited in silence till the sound
of wheels announced that the Warden was
out of hearing: then, to my surprise, they
broke into peals of uncontrollable laughter.</p>
<p>“What a game, oh, what a game!” cried
the Chancellor. And he and the Vice-Warden
joined hands, and skipped wildly about the
room. My Lady was too dignified to skip,
but she laughed like the neighing of a horse,
and waved her handkerchief above her head:
it was clear to her very limited understanding
that <i>something</i> very clever had been done, but
what it <i>was</i> she had yet to learn.</p>
<p>“You said I should hear all about it when
the Warden had gone,” she remarked, as soon
as she could make herself heard.</p>
<p>“And so you shall, Tabby!” her husband
graciously replied, as he removed the blotting-paper,
and showed the two parchments lying
side by side. “This is the one he read but
didn’t sign: and this is the one he signed but
didn’t read! You see it was all covered up,
except the place for signing the names——”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes!” my Lady interrupted eagerly,
and began comparing the two Agreements.
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
“‘<i>Item</i>, that he shall exercise the authority
of Warden, in the Warden’s absence.’ Why,
that’s been changed into ‘shall be absolute
governor for life, with the title of Emperor, if
elected to that office by the people.’ What!
Are you <i>Emperor</i>, darling?”</p>
<p>“Not yet, dear,” the Vice-Warden replied.
“It won’t do to let this paper be seen, just
at present. All in good time.”</p>
<p>My Lady nodded, and read on. “‘<i>Item</i>, that
we will be kind to the poor.’ Why, that’s
omitted altogether!”</p>
<p>“Course it is!” said her husband. “<i>We’re</i>
not going to bother about the wretches!”</p>
<p>“<i>Good</i>,” said my Lady, with emphasis, and
read on again. “‘<i>Item</i>, that the contents of
the Treasury be preserved intact.’ Why, that’s
altered into ‘shall be at the absolute disposal
of the Vice-Warden’! Well, Sibby, that <i>was</i>
a clever trick! <i>All</i> the Jewels, only think!
May I go and put them on directly?”</p>
<p>“Well, not <i>just</i> yet, Lovey,” her husband
uneasily replied. “You see the public mind
isn’t quite <i>ripe</i> for it yet. We must feel our
way. Of course we’ll have the coach-and-four
<span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
out, at once. And I’ll take the title of Emperor,
as soon as we can safely hold an Election.
But they’ll hardly stand our using the
<i>Jewels</i>, as long as they know the Warden’s
alive. We must spread a report of his death.
A little Conspiracy——”</p>
<p>“A Conspiracy!” cried the delighted lady,
clapping her hands. “Of all things, I <i>do</i> like
a Conspiracy! It’s so interesting!”</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden and the Chancellor interchanged
a wink or two. “Let her conspire to
her heart’s content!” the cunning Chancellor
whispered. “It’ll do no harm!”</p>
<p>“And when will the Conspiracy——”</p>
<p>“Hist!” her husband hastily interrupted
her, as the door opened, and Sylvie and Bruno
came in, with their arms twined lovingly round
each other—Bruno sobbing convulsively, with
his face hidden on his sister’s shoulder, and
Sylvie more grave and quiet, but with tears
streaming down her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Mustn’t cry like that!” the Vice-Warden
said sharply, but without any effect on the
weeping children. “Cheer ’em up a bit!” he
hinted to my Lady.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>“<i>Cake!</i>” my Lady muttered to herself with
great decision, crossing the room and opening a
cupboard, from which she presently returned
with two slices of plum-cake. “Eat, and don’t
cry!” were her short and simple orders: and
the poor children sat down side by side, but
seemed in no mood for eating.</p>
<p>For the second time the door opened—or
rather was <i>burst</i> open, this time, as Uggug
rushed violently into the room, shouting “that
old Beggar’s come again!”</p>
<p>“He’s not to have any food——” the Vice-Warden
was beginning, but the Chancellor
interrupted him. “It’s all right,” he said, in a
low voice: “the servants have their orders.”</p>
<p>“He’s just under here,” said Uggug, who had
gone to the window, and was looking down into
the court-yard.</p>
<p>“Where, my darling?” said his fond mother,
flinging her arms round the neck of the little
monster. All of us (except Sylvie and Bruno,
who took no notice of what was going on)
followed her to the window. The old Beggar
looked up at us with hungry eyes. “Only a
crust of bread, your Highness!” he pleaded.
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
He was a fine
old man, but
looked sadly
ill and worn.
“A crust of
bread is what
I crave!” he
repeated. “A
single crust, and
a little water!”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig7">
<img src="images/i053.jpg" alt="‘DRINK THIS!’" width="500" height="1158" />
<p class="center small">‘DRINK THIS!’</p>
</div>
<p>“Here’s some
water, drink this!”
Uggug bellowed, emptying
a jug of water over
his head.</p>
<p>“Well done, my boy!”
cried the Vice-Warden.
“That’s the way to settle
such folk!”</p>
<p>“Clever boy!” the
Wardeness chimed
in. “<i>Hasn’t</i> he
good spirits?”</p>
<p>“Take a stick
to him!” shouted
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
the Vice-Warden, as the old Beggar shook the
water from his ragged cloak, and again gazed
meekly upwards.</p>
<p>“Take a red-hot poker to him!” my Lady
again chimed in.</p>
<p>Possibly there was no red-hot poker handy:
but some <i>sticks</i> were forthcoming in a moment,
and threatening faces surrounded the poor old
wanderer, who waved them back with quiet
dignity. “No need to break my old bones,”
he said. “I am going. Not even a crust!”</p>
<p>“Poor, <i>poor</i> old man!” exclaimed a little voice
at my side, half choked with sobs. Bruno was
at the window, trying to throw out his slice of
plum-cake, but Sylvie held him back.</p>
<p>“He <i>shall</i> have my cake!” Bruno cried, passionately
struggling out of Sylvie’s arms.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, darling!” Sylvie gently pleaded.
“But don’t <i>throw</i> it out! He’s gone away,
don’t you see? Let’s go after him.” And she
led him out of the room, unnoticed by the rest
of the party, who were wholly absorbed in
watching the old Beggar.</p>
<p>The Conspirators returned to their seats, and
continued their conversation in an undertone,
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
so as not to be heard by Uggug, who was still
standing at the window.</p>
<p>“By the way, there was something about
Bruno succeeding to the Wardenship,” said
my Lady. “How does <i>that</i> stand in the
new Agreement?”</p>
<p>The Chancellor chuckled. “Just the same,
word for word,” he said, “with <i>one</i> exception,
my Lady. Instead of ‘Bruno,’ I’ve taken the
liberty to put in——” he dropped his voice to
a whisper, “—to put in ‘Uggug,’ you know!”</p>
<p>“Uggug, indeed!” I exclaimed, in a burst
of indignation I could no longer control. To
bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic
effort: but, the cry once uttered, all effort
ceased at once: a sudden gust swept away
the whole scene, and I found myself sitting
up, staring at the young lady in the opposite
corner of the carriage, who had now thrown
back her veil, and was looking at me with
an expression of amused surprise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
<br /><span class="small">A BEGGAR’S PALACE.</span></h2>
<p>That I had said <i>something</i>, in the act of
waking, I felt sure: the hoarse stifled cry was
still ringing in my ears, even if the startled
look of my fellow-traveler had not been evidence
enough: but what could I possibly say
by way of apology?</p>
<p>“I hope I didn’t frighten you?” I stammered
out at last. “I have no idea what I
said. I was dreaming.”</p>
<p>“You said ‘<i>Uggug indeed!</i>’” the young lady
replied, with quivering lips that <i>would</i> curve
themselves into a smile, in spite of all her
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
efforts to look grave. “At least—you didn’t
<i>say</i> it—you <i>shouted</i> it!”</p>
<p>“I’m very sorry,” was all I could say, feeling
very penitent and helpless. “She <i>has</i> Sylvie’s
eyes!” I thought to myself, half-doubting
whether, even now, I were fairly awake. “And
that sweet look of innocent wonder is all
Sylvie’s, too. But Sylvie <i>hasn’t</i> got that calm
resolute mouth—nor that far-away look of
dreamy sadness, like one that has had some
deep sorrow, very long ago——” And the
thick-coming fancies almost prevented my hearing
the lady’s next words.</p>
<p>“If you had had a ‘Shilling Dreadful’ in
your hand,” she proceeded, “something about
Ghosts—or Dynamite—or Midnight Murder—one
could understand it: those things
aren’t worth the shilling, unless they give one a
Nightmare. But really—with only a <i>medical
treatise</i>, you know——” and she glanced,
with a pretty shrug of contempt, at the book
over which I had fallen asleep.</p>
<p>Her friendliness, and utter unreserve, took
me aback for a moment; yet there was no touch
of forwardness, or boldness, about the child—for
<span class="pb" id="Page_58">58</span>
child, almost, she seemed to be: I guessed
her at scarcely over twenty—all was the innocent
frankness of some angelic visitant, new
to the ways of earth and the conventionalisms—or,
if you will, the barbarisms—of Society.
“Even so,” I mused, “will <i>Sylvie</i> look and
speak, in another ten years.”</p>
<p>“You don’t care for Ghosts, then,” I ventured
to suggest, “unless they are really terrifying?”</p>
<p>“Quite so,” the lady assented. “The regular
Railway-Ghosts—I mean the Ghosts of ordinary
Railway-literature—are very poor affairs.
I feel inclined to say, with Alexander Selkirk,
‘Their tameness is shocking to me’! And they
never do any Midnight Murders. They couldn’t
‘welter in gore,’ to save their lives!”</p>
<p>“‘Weltering in gore’ is a very expressive
phrase, certainly. Can it be done in <i>any</i> fluid,
I wonder?”</p>
<p>“I think <i>not</i>,” the lady readily replied—quite
as if she had thought it out, long ago.
“It has to be something <i>thick</i>. For instance,
you might welter in bread-sauce. That, being
<i>white</i>, would be more suitable for a Ghost,
supposing it wished to welter!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>“You have a real good <i>terrifying</i> Ghost
in that book?” I hinted.</p>
<p>“How <i>could</i> you guess?” she exclaimed
with the most engaging frankness, and placed
the volume in my hands. I opened it eagerly,
with a not unpleasant thrill (like what a good
ghost-story gives one) at the ‘uncanny’ coincidence
of my having so unexpectedly divined
the subject of her studies.</p>
<p>It was a book of Domestic Cookery, open
at the article ‘Bread Sauce.’</p>
<p>I returned the book, looking, I suppose, a
little blank, as the lady laughed merrily at my
discomfiture. “It’s far more exciting than some
of the modern ghosts, I assure you! Now there
was a Ghost last month—I don’t mean a <i>real</i>
Ghost in—in Supernature—but in a Magazine.
It was a perfectly <i>flavourless</i> Ghost. It
wouldn’t have frightened a mouse! It wasn’t
a Ghost that one would even offer a chair to!”</p>
<p>“Three score years and ten, baldness, and
spectacles, have their advantages after all!” I
said to myself. “Instead of a bashful youth
and maiden, gasping out monosyllables at awful
intervals, here we have an old man and a
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
child, quite at their ease, talking as if they had
known each other for years! Then you think,”
I continued aloud, “that we ought <i>sometimes</i> to
ask a Ghost to sit down? But have we any
authority for it? In Shakespeare, for instance—there
are plenty of ghosts <i>there</i>—does
Shakespeare ever give the stage-direction
‘<i>hands chair to Ghost</i>’?”</p>
<p>The lady looked puzzled and thoughtful for
a moment: then she <i>almost</i> clapped her hands.
“Yes, yes, he <i>does</i>!” she cried. “He makes
Hamlet say ‘<i>Rest, rest, perturbed Spirit!</i>’”</p>
<p>“And that, I suppose, means an easy-chair?”</p>
<p>“An American rocking-chair, I <i>think</i>——”</p>
<p>“Fayfield Junction, my Lady, change for
Elveston!” the guard announced, flinging open
the door of the carriage: and we soon found
ourselves, with all our portable property around
us, on the platform.</p>
<p>The accommodation, provided for passengers
waiting at this Junction, was distinctly inadequate—a
single wooden bench, apparently
intended for three sitters only: and even this
was already partially occupied by a very old
man, in a smock frock, who sat, with rounded
<span class="pb" id="Page_61">61</span>
shoulders and drooping head, and with hands
clasped on the top of his stick so as to make
a sort of pillow for that wrinkled face with
its look of patient weariness.</p>
<p>“Come, you be off!” the Station-master
roughly accosted the poor old man. “You
be off, and make way for your betters! This
way, my Lady!” he added in a perfectly different
tone. “If your Ladyship will take a
seat, the train will be up in a few minutes.”
The cringing servility of his manner was due,
no doubt, to the address legible on the pile of
luggage, which announced their owner to be
“Lady Muriel Orme, passenger to Elveston,
<i>viâ</i> Fayfield Junction.”</p>
<p>As I watched the old man slowly rise to his
feet, and hobble a few paces down the platform,
the lines came to my lips:—</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“From sackcloth couch the Monk arose,</p>
<p class="t">With toil his stiffen’d limbs he rear’d;</p>
<p class="t0">A hundred years had flung their snows</p>
<p class="t">On his thin locks and floating beard.”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<div class="img" id="fig8">
<img src="images/i062.jpg" alt="‘COME, YOU BE OFF!’" width="500" height="717" />
<p class="center small">‘COME, YOU BE OFF!’</p>
</div>
<p>But the lady scarcely noticed the little incident.
After one glance at the ‘banished
man,’ who stood tremulously leaning on his
stick, she turned to me. “This is <i>not</i> an
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
American rocking-chair, by any means! Yet
may I say,” slightly changing her place, so as
to make room for me beside her, “may I say,
in Hamlet’s words, ‘Rest, rest——’” she broke
off with a silvery laugh.</p>
<p>“‘—perturbed Spirit!’” I finished the
sentence for her. “Yes, that describes a railway-traveler
<i>exactly</i>! And here is an instance
of it,” I added, as the tiny local train drew
up alongside the platform, and the porters
bustled about, opening carriage-doors—one of
them helping the poor old man to hoist himself
into a third-class carriage, while another
of them obsequiously conducted the lady and
myself into a first-class.</p>
<p>She paused, before following him, to watch
the progress of the other passenger. “Poor
old man!” she said. “How weak and ill he
looks! It was a shame to let him be turned
away like that. I’m very sorry——” At this
moment it dawned on me that these words
were not addressed to <i>me</i>, but that she was
unconsciously thinking aloud. I moved away
a few steps, and waited to follow her into the
carriage, where I resumed the conversation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<p>“Shakespeare <i>must</i> have traveled by rail,
if only in a dream: ‘perturbed Spirit’ is such
a happy phrase.”</p>
<p>“‘Perturbed’ referring, no doubt,” she rejoined,
“to the sensational booklets peculiar
to the Rail. If Steam has done nothing else,
it has at least added a whole new Species
to English Literature!”</p>
<p>“No doubt of it,” I echoed. “The true
origin of all our medical books—and all our
cookery-books——”</p>
<p>“No, no!” she broke in merrily. “I didn’t
mean <i>our</i> Literature! <i>We</i> are quite abnormal.
But the booklets—the little thrilling romances,
where the Murder comes at page fifteen, and
the Wedding at page forty—surely <i>they</i> are
due to Steam?”</p>
<p>“And when we travel by Electricity—if I
may venture to develop your theory—we
shall have leaflets instead of booklets, and
the Murder and the Wedding will come on
the same page.”</p>
<p>“A development worthy of Darwin!” the
lady exclaimed enthusiastically. “Only <i>you</i>
reverse his theory. Instead of developing a
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
mouse into an elephant, you would develop
an elephant into a mouse!” But here we
plunged into a tunnel, and I leaned back and
closed my eyes for a moment, trying to recall
a few of the incidents of my recent dream.</p>
<p>“I thought I saw——” I murmured sleepily:
and then the phrase insisted on conjugating
itself, and ran into “you thought you saw—he
thought he saw——” and then it suddenly
went off into a song:—</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He thought he saw an Elephant,</p>
<p class="t">That practised on a fife:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A letter from his wife.</p>
<p class="t0">‘At length I realise,’ he said,</p>
<p class="t">‘The bitterness of Life!’”</p>
</div>
<p>And what a wild being it was who sang
these wild words! A Gardener he seemed to
be—yet surely a mad one, by the way he
brandished his rake—madder, by the way he
broke, ever and anon, into a frantic jig—maddest
of all, by the shriek in which he
brought out the last words of the stanza!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>It was so far a description
of himself
that he had the <i>feet</i>
of an Elephant: but
the rest of him was
skin and bone: and
the wisps of loose
straw, that bristled
all about him, suggested
that he had
been originally stuffed
with it, and that
nearly all the stuffing
had come out.</p>

<p class="center small">THE GARDENER</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvie and Bruno waited patiently till the
end of the first verse. Then Sylvie advanced
alone (Bruno having suddenly turned shy) and
timidly introduced herself with the words
“Please, I’m Sylvie!”</p>
<p>“And who’s that other thing?” said the
Gardener.</p>
<p>“What thing?” said Sylvie, looking round.
“Oh, that’s Bruno. He’s my brother.”</p>
<p>“Was he your brother yesterday?” the
Gardener anxiously enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>“Course I were!” cried Bruno, who had
gradually crept nearer, and didn’t at all like
being talked about without having his share
in the conversation.</p>
<p>“Ah, well!” the Gardener said with a kind
of groan. “Things change so, here. Whenever
I look again, it’s sure to be something
different! Yet I does my duty! I gets up
wriggle-early at five——”</p>
<p>“If I was <i>oo</i>,” said Bruno, “I wouldn’t
wriggle so early. It’s as bad as being a
worm!” he added, in an undertone to Sylvie.</p>
<p>“But you shouldn’t be lazy in the morning,
Bruno,” said Sylvie. “Remember, it’s the
<i>early</i> bird that picks up the worm!”</p>
<p>“It may, if it likes!” Bruno said with a
slight yawn. “I don’t like eating worms, one
bit. I always stop in bed till the early bird
has picked them up!”</p>
<p>“I wonder you’ve the face to tell me such
fibs!” cried the Gardener.</p>
<p>To which Bruno wisely replied “Oo don’t
want a <i>face</i> to tell fibs wiz—only a <i>mouf</i>.”</p>
<p>Sylvie discreetly changed the subject. “And
did you plant all these flowers?” she said.
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
“What a lovely garden you’ve made! Do
you know, I’d like to live here <i>always</i>!”</p>
<p>“In the winter-nights——” the Gardener
was beginning.</p>
<p>“But I’d nearly forgotten what we came
about!” Sylvie interrupted. “Would you
please let us through into the road? There’s
a poor old beggar just gone out—and he’s
very hungry—and Bruno wants to give him
his cake, you know!”</p>
<p>“It’s as much as my place is worth!” the
Gardener muttered, taking a key from his
pocket, and beginning to unlock a door in
the garden-wall.</p>
<p>“How much <i>are</i> it wurf?” Bruno innocently
enquired.</p>
<p>But the Gardener only grinned. “That’s a
secret!” he said. “Mind you come back
quick!” he called after the children, as they
passed out into the road. I had just time to
follow them, before he shut the door again.</p>
<p>We hurried down the road, and very soon
caught sight of the old Beggar, about a
quarter of a mile ahead of us, and the children
at once set off running to overtake him.
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
Lightly and swiftly they skimmed over the
ground, and I could not in the least understand
how it was I kept up with them so easily. But
the unsolved problem did not worry me so
much as at another time it might have done,
there were so many other things to attend to.</p>
<p>The old Beggar must have been very deaf, as
he paid no attention whatever to Bruno’s eager
shouting, but trudged wearily on, never pausing
until the child got in front of him and held up
the slice of cake. The poor little fellow was
quite out of breath, and could only utter the one
word “Cake!”—not with the gloomy decision
with which Her Excellency had so lately pronounced
it, but with a sweet childish timidity,
looking up into the old man’s face with eyes
that loved ‘all things both great and small.’</p>
<p>The old man snatched it from him, and devoured
it greedily, as some hungry wild beast
might have done, but never a word of thanks
did he give his little benefactor—only growled
“More, more!” and glared at the half-frightened
children.</p>
<p>“There <i>is</i> no more!” Sylvie said with tears
in her eyes. “I’d eaten mine. It was a shame
<span class="pb" id="Page_70">70</span>
to let you be turned away like that. I’m
very sorry——”</p>
<p>I lost the rest of the sentence, for my mind
had recurred, with a great shock of surprise, to
Lady Muriel Orme, who had so lately uttered
these very words of Sylvie’s—yes, and in
Sylvie’s own voice, and with Sylvie’s gentle
pleading eyes!</p>
<p>“Follow me!” were the next words I heard,
as the old man waved his hand, with a dignified
grace that ill suited his ragged dress, over a
bush, that stood by the road side, which began
instantly to sink into the earth. At another
time I might have doubted the evidence of
my eyes, or at least have felt some astonishment:
but, in <i>this</i> strange scene, my whole
being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as
to what would happen next.</p>
<p>When the bush had sunk quite out of our
sight, marble steps were seen, leading downwards
into darkness. The old man led the way,
and we eagerly followed.</p>
<p>The staircase was so dark, at first, that I could
only just see the forms of the children, as, hand-in-hand,
they groped their way down after their
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
guide: but it got lighter every moment, with a
strange silvery brightness, that seemed to exist
in the air, as there were no lamps visible; and,
when at last we reached a level floor, the room,
in which we found ourselves, was almost as
light as day.</p>
<p>It was eight-sided, having in each angle a
slender pillar, round which silken draperies
were twined. The wall between the pillars was
entirely covered, to the height of six or seven
feet, with creepers, from which hung quantities
of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers, that almost
hid the leaves. In another place, perchance, I
might have wondered to see fruit and flowers
growing together: here, my chief wonder was
that neither fruit nor flowers were such as I
had ever seen before. Higher up, each wall
contained a circular window of coloured glass;
and over all was an arched roof, that seemed
to be spangled all over with jewels.</p>
<p>With hardly less wonder, I turned this way
and that, trying to make out how in the world
we had come in: for there was no door: and
all the walls were thickly covered with the
lovely creepers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>“We are safe here, my darlings!” said the
old man, laying a hand on Sylvie’s shoulder, and
bending down to kiss her. Sylvie drew back
hastily, with an offended air: but in another
moment, with a glad cry of “Why, it’s <i>Father</i>!”,
she had run into his arms.</p>

<p class="center small">A BEGGAR’S PALACE</p>
</div>
<p>“Father! Father!” Bruno repeated: and,
while the happy children were being hugged
and kissed, I could but rub my eyes and say
“Where, then, are the rags gone to?”; for the
old man was now dressed in royal robes that
glittered with jewels and gold embroidery, and
wore a circlet of gold around his head.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
<br /><span class="small">THE MAGIC LOCKET.</span></h2>
<p>“Where are we, father?” Sylvie whispered,
with her arms twined closely around the old
man’s neck, and with her rosy cheek lovingly
pressed to his.</p>
<p>“In Elfland, darling. It’s one of the provinces
of Fairyland.”</p>
<p>“But I thought Elfland was <i>ever</i> so far
from Outland: and we’ve come such a <i>tiny</i>
little way!”</p>
<p>“You came by the Royal Road, sweet one.
Only those of royal blood can travel along it:
but <i>you’ve</i> been royal ever since I was made
<span class="pb" id="Page_74">74</span>
King of Elfland—that’s nearly a month ago.
They sent <i>two</i> ambassadors, to make sure
that their invitation to me, to be their new
King, should reach me. One was a Prince;
so <i>he</i> was able to come by the Royal Road,
and to come invisibly to all but me: the other
was a Baron; so <i>he</i> had to come by the
common road, and I dare say he hasn’t even
<i>arrived</i> yet.”</p>
<p>“Then how far have we come?” Sylvie
enquired.</p>
<p>“Just a thousand miles, sweet one, since the
Gardener unlocked that door for you.”</p>
<p>“A thousand miles!” Bruno repeated.
“And may I eat one?”</p>
<p>“Eat a <i>mile</i>, little rogue?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Bruno. “I mean may I eat one
of that fruits?”</p>
<p>“Yes, child,” said his father: “and then
you’ll find out what <i>Pleasure</i> is like—the
Pleasure we all seek so madly, and enjoy so
mournfully!”</p>
<p>Bruno ran eagerly to the wall, and picked a
fruit that was <i>shaped</i> something like a banana,
but had the <i>colour</i> of a strawberry.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>He ate it with beaming looks, that became
gradually more gloomy, and were very blank
indeed by the time he had finished.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t got no taste at all!” he complained.
“I couldn’t feel nuffin in my mouf! It’s a—what’s
that hard word, Sylvie?”</p>
<p>“It was a <i>Phlizz</i>,” Sylvie gravely replied.
“Are they <i>all</i> like that, father?”</p>
<p>“They’re all like that to <i>you</i>, darling, because
you don’t belong to Elfland—yet. But
to <i>me</i> they are real.”</p>
<p>Bruno looked puzzled. “I’ll try anuvver
kind of fruits!” he said, and jumped down off
the King’s knee. “There’s some lovely striped
ones, just like a rainbow!” And off he ran.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the Fairy-King and Sylvie were
talking together, but in such low tones that I
could not catch the words: so I followed Bruno,
who was picking and eating other kinds of
fruit, in the vain hope of finding <i>some</i> that had
a taste. I tried to pick some myself—but it
was like grasping air, and I soon gave up the
attempt and returned to Sylvie.</p>
<p>“Look well at it, my darling,” the old man
was saying, “and tell me how you like it.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>“It’s just <i>lovely</i>,” cried Sylvie, delightedly.
“Bruno, come and look!” And she held up,
so that he might see the light through it, a
heart-shaped Locket, apparently cut out of a
single jewel, of a rich blue colour, with a
slender gold chain attached to it.</p>
<p>“It are welly pretty,” Bruno more soberly
remarked: and he began spelling out some
words inscribed on it. “All—will—love—Sylvie,”
he made them out at last. “And so
they doos!” he cried, clasping his arms round
her neck. “<i>Everybody</i> loves Sylvie!”</p>
<p>“But <i>we</i> love her best, don’t we, Bruno?”
said the old King, as he took possession of the
Locket. “Now, Sylvie, look at <i>this</i>.” And he
showed her, lying on the palm of his hand,
a Locket of a deep crimson colour, the same
shape as the blue one and, like it, attached
to a slender golden chain.</p>
<p>“Lovelier and lovelier!” exclaimed Sylvie,
clasping her hands in ecstasy. “Look, Bruno!”</p>
<p>“And there’s words on this one, too,” said
Bruno. “Sylvie—will—love—all.”</p>
<p>“Now you see the difference,” said the old
man: “different colours and different words.
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
Choose one of them, darling. I’ll give you
whichever you like best.”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">

<p class="center small">THE CRIMSON LOCKET</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvie whispered the words, several times
over, with a thoughtful smile, and then made
her decision. “It’s <i>very</i> nice to be loved,”
she said: “but it’s nicer to love other people!
May I have the red one, Father?”</p>
<p>The old man said nothing: but I could see
his eyes fill with tears, as he bent his head
and pressed his lips to her forehead in a long
loving kiss. Then he undid the chain, and
showed her how to fasten it round her neck,
and to hide it away under the edge of her
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
frock. “It’s for you to <i>keep</i>, you know,” he
said in a low voice, “not for other people to
<i>see</i>. You’ll remember how to use it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll remember,” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“And now, darlings, it’s time for you to
go back, or they’ll be missing you, and then
that poor Gardener will get into trouble!”</p>
<p>Once more a feeling of wonder rose in my
mind as to how in the world we were to <i>get</i>
back again—since I took it for granted that,
wherever the children went, <i>I</i> was to go—but
no shadow of doubt seemed to cross <i>their</i>
minds, as they hugged and kissed him, murmuring,
over and over again, “Good-bye,
darling Father!” And then, suddenly and
swiftly, the darkness of midnight seemed to
close in upon us, and through the darkness
harshly rang a strange wild song:—</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He thought he saw a Buffalo</p>

<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>

<p class="center small">‘HE THOUGHT HE SAW A BUFFALO’</p>
</div>
<p>“That was <i>me</i>!” he added, looking out at
us, through the half-opened door, as we stood
waiting in the road. “And that’s what I’d
have done—as sure as potatoes aren’t radishes—if
she hadn’t have tooken herself off! But
I always loves my <i>pay-rints</i> like anything.”</p>
<p>“Who are oor <i>pay-rints</i>?” said Bruno.</p>
<p>“Them as pay <i>rint</i> for me, a course!” the
Gardener replied. “You can come in now, if
you like.”</p>
<p>He flung the door open as he spoke, and we
got out, a little dazzled and stupefied (at least <i>I</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
felt so) at the sudden transition from the half-darkness
of the railway-carriage to the brilliantly-lighted
platform of Elveston Station.</p>
<p>A footman, in a handsome livery, came
forwards and respectfully touched his hat.
“The carriage is here, my Lady,” he said,
taking from her the wraps and small articles
she was carrying: and Lady Muriel, after
shaking hands and bidding me “Good-night!”
with a pleasant smile, followed him.</p>
<p>It was with a somewhat blank and lonely
feeling that I betook myself to the van from
which the luggage was being taken out: and,
after giving directions to have my boxes sent
after me, I made my way on foot to Arthur’s
lodgings, and soon lost my lonely feeling in the
hearty welcome my old friend gave me, and
the cozy warmth and cheerful light of the little
sitting-room into which he led me.</p>
<p>“Little, as you see, but quite enough for us
two. Now, take the easy-chair, old fellow, and
let’s have another look at you! Well, you <i>do</i>
look a bit pulled down!” and he put on a
solemn professional air. “I prescribe Ozone,
<i>quant. suff.</i> Social dissipation, <i>fiant pilulæ
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
quam plurimæ</i>: to be taken, feasting, three
times a day!”</p>
<p>“But, Doctor!” I remonstrated. “Society
doesn’t ‘receive’ three times a day!”</p>
<p>“That’s all <i>you</i> know about it!” the young
Doctor gaily replied. “At home, lawn-tennis,
3 <span class="small">P.M.</span> At home, kettledrum, 5 <span class="small">P.M.</span> At home,
music (Elveston doesn’t give dinners), 8 <span class="small">P.M.</span>
Carriages at 10. There you are!”</p>
<p>It sounded very pleasant, I was obliged to
admit. “And I know some of the <i>lady</i>-society
already,” I added. “One of them came in
the same carriage with me.”</p>
<p>“What was she like? Then perhaps I can
identify her.”</p>
<p>“The <i>name</i> was Lady Muriel Orme. As to
what she was <i>like</i>—well, <i>I</i> thought her very
beautiful. Do you know her?”</p>
<p>“Yes—I do know her.” And the grave
Doctor coloured slightly as he added “Yes, I
agree with you. She <i>is</i> beautiful.”</p>
<p>“<i>I</i> quite lost my heart to her!” I went on
mischievously. “We talked——”</p>
<p>“Have some supper!” Arthur interrupted
with an air of relief, as the maid entered with
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
the tray. And he steadily resisted all my
attempts to return to the subject of Lady
Muriel until the evening had almost worn itself
away. Then, as we sat gazing into the fire,
and conversation was lapsing into silence, he
made a hurried confession.</p>
<p>“I hadn’t meant to tell you anything about
her,” he said (naming no names, as if there
were only one ‘she’ in the world!) “till you
had seen more of her, and formed your own
judgment of her: but somehow you surprised
it out of me. And I’ve not breathed a word
of it to any one else. But I can trust <i>you</i> with
a secret, old friend! Yes! It’s true of <i>me</i>,
what I suppose <i>you</i> said in jest.”</p>
<p>“In the merest jest, believe me!” I said
earnestly. “Why, man, I’m three times her
age! But if she’s <i>your</i> choice, then I’m sure
she’s all that is good and——”</p>
<p>“—and sweet,” Arthur went on, “and pure,
and self-denying, and true-hearted, and—” he
broke off hastily, as if he could not trust himself
to say more on a subject so sacred and so
precious. Silence followed: and I leaned back
drowsily in my easy-chair, filled with bright
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
and beautiful imaginings of Arthur and his
lady-love, and of all the peace and happiness
in store for them.</p>
<p>I pictured them to myself walking together,
lingeringly and lovingly, under arching trees,
in a sweet garden of their own, and welcomed
back by their faithful gardener, on their return
from some brief excursion.</p>
<p>It seemed natural enough that the gardener
should be filled with exuberant delight at the
return of so gracious a master and mistress—and
how strangely childlike they looked!
I could have taken them for Sylvie and Bruno—less
natural that he should show it by such
wild dances, such crazy songs!</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He thought he saw a Rattlesnake</p>
<p class="t2">That questioned him in Greek:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>

<p class="t0">‘The one thing I regret,’ he said,</p>
<p class="t2">‘Is that it cannot speak!’”</p>
</div>
<p>—least natural of all that the Vice-Warden
and ‘my Lady’ should be standing close beside
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
me, discussing an open letter, which had
just been handed to him by the Professor,
who stood, meekly waiting, a few yards off.</p>
<p>“If it were not for those two brats,” I
heard him mutter, glancing savagely at Sylvie
and Bruno, who were courteously listening to
the Gardener’s song, “there would be no
difficulty whatever.”</p>
<p>“Let’s hear that bit of the letter again,”
said my Lady. And the Vice-Warden read
aloud:—</p>
<p>“——and we therefore entreat you graciously
to accept the Kingship, to which you
have been unanimously elected by the Council
of Elfland: and that you will allow your
son Bruno—of whose goodness, cleverness,
and beauty, reports have reached us—to be
regarded as Heir-Apparent.”</p>
<p>“But what’s the difficulty?” said my Lady.</p>
<p>“Why, don’t you see? The Ambassador,
that brought this, is waiting in the house:
and he’s sure to see Sylvie and Bruno: and
then, when he sees Uggug, and remembers
all that about ‘goodness, cleverness, and
beauty,’ why, he’s sure to——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>“And <i>where</i> will you find a better boy than
<i>Uggug</i>?” my Lady indignantly interrupted.
“Or a wittier, or a lovelier?”</p>
<p>To all of which the Vice-Warden simply
replied “Don’t you be a great blethering
goose! Our only chance is to keep those
two brats out of sight. If <i>you</i> can manage
<i>that</i>, you may leave the rest to <i>me</i>. <i>I’ll</i> make
him believe Uggug to be a model of cleverness
and all that.”</p>
<p>“We must change his name to Bruno, of
course?” said my Lady.</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden rubbed his chin. “Humph!
No!” he said musingly. “Wouldn’t do. The
boy’s such an utter idiot, he’d never learn to
answer to it.”</p>
<p>“<i>Idiot</i>, indeed!” cried my Lady. “He’s
no more an idiot than <i>I</i> am!”</p>
<p>“You’re right, my dear,” the Vice-Warden
soothingly replied. “He isn’t, indeed!”</p>
<p>My Lady was appeased. “Let’s go in and
receive the Ambassador,” she said, and beckoned
to the Professor. “Which room is he waiting
in?” she inquired.</p>
<p>“In the Library, Madam.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>“And <i>what</i> did you say his name was?”
said the Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>The Professor referred to a card he held
in his hand. “His Adiposity the Baron
Doppelgeist.”</p>
<p>“Why does he come with such a funny
name?” said my Lady.</p>
<p>“He couldn’t well change it on the journey,”
the Professor meekly replied, “because
of the luggage.”</p>
<p>“<i>You</i> go and receive him,” my Lady said
to the Vice-Warden, “and <i>I’ll</i> attend to the
children.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
<br /><span class="small">THE BARON’S EMBASSY.</span></h2>
<p>I was following the Vice-Warden, but, on
second thoughts, went after my Lady, being
curious to see how she would manage to keep
the children out of sight.</p>
<p>I found her holding Sylvie’s hand, and
with her other hand stroking Bruno’s hair
in a most tender and motherly fashion: both
children were looking bewildered and half-frightened.</p>
<p>“My own darlings,” she was saying, “I’ve
been planning a little treat for you! The
Professor shall take you a long walk into the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
woods this beautiful evening: and you shall
take a basket of food with you, and have a
little picnic down by the river!”</p>
<p>Bruno jumped, and clapped his hands. “That
<i>are</i> nice!” he cried. “Aren’t it, Sylvie?”</p>
<p>Sylvie, who hadn’t quite lost her surprised
look, put up her mouth for a kiss. “Thank
you <i>very</i> much,” she said earnestly.</p>
<p>My Lady turned her head away to conceal
the broad grin of triumph that spread
over her vast face, like a ripple on a
lake. “Little simpletons!” she muttered to
herself, as she marched up to the house. I
followed her in.</p>
<p>“Quite so, your Excellency,” the Baron was
saying as we entered the Library. “All the
infantry were under <i>my</i> command.” He turned,
and was duly presented to my Lady.</p>
<p>“A <i>military</i> hero?” said my Lady. The fat
little man simpered. “Well, yes,” he replied,
modestly casting down his eyes. “My ancestors
were all famous for military genius.”</p>
<p>My Lady smiled graciously. “It often runs
in families,” she remarked: “just as a love for
pastry does.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>The Baron looked slightly offended, and the
Vice-Warden discreetly changed the subject.
“Dinner will soon be ready,” he said. “May
I have the honour of conducting your Adiposity
to the guest-chamber?”</p>
<p>“Certainly, certainly!” the Baron eagerly
assented. “It would never do to keep <i>dinner</i>
waiting!” And he almost trotted out of the
room after the Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>He was back again so speedily that the Vice-Warden
had barely time to explain to my Lady
that her remark about “a love for pastry” was
“unfortunate. You might have seen, with
half an eye,” he added, “that that’s <i>his</i> line.
Military genius, indeed! Pooh!”</p>
<p>“Dinner ready yet?” the Baron enquired, as
he hurried into the room.</p>
<p>“Will be in a few minutes,” the Vice-Warden
replied. “Meanwhile, let’s take a turn in the
garden. You were telling me,” he continued,
as the trio left the house, “something about a
great battle in which you had the command
of the infantry——”</p>
<p>“True,” said the Baron. “The enemy, as I
was saying, far outnumbered us: but I marched
<span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
my men right into the middle of—what’s
that?” the Military Hero exclaimed in agitated
tones, drawing back behind the Vice-Warden,
as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them,
brandishing a spade.</p>
<p>“It’s only the Gardener!” the Vice-Warden
replied in an encouraging tone. “Quite harmless,
I assure you. Hark, he’s singing! It’s
his favorite amusement.”</p>
<p>And once more those shrill discordant tones
rang out:—</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He thought he saw a Banker’s Clerk</p>
<p class="t">Descending from the bus:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Hippopotamus:</p>
<p class="t0">‘If this should stay to dine,’ he said,</p>
<p class="t">‘There won’t be much for us!’”</p>
</div>
<p>Throwing away the spade, he broke into a
frantic jig, snapping his fingers, and repeating,
again and again</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“There won’t be much for us!</p>
<p class="t0">There won’t be much for us!”</p>
</div>

<p class="center small">‘IT WAS A HIPPOPOTAMUS’</p>
</div>
<p>Once more the Baron looked slightly offended,
but the Vice-Warden hastily explained that the
song had no allusion to <i>him</i>, and in fact had no
meaning at all. “You didn’t mean anything by
it, now <i>did</i> you?” He appealed to the Gardener,
who had finished his song, and stood,
balancing himself on one leg, and looking at
them, with his mouth open.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>“I never means nothing,” said the Gardener:
and Uggug luckily came up at the moment,
and gave the conversation a new turn.</p>
<p>“Allow me to present my son,” said the Vice-Warden;
adding, in a whisper, “one of the best
and cleverest boys that ever lived! I’ll contrive
for you to see some of his cleverness. He
knows everything that other boys <i>don’t</i> know;
and in archery, in fishing, in painting, and in
music, his skill is—but you shall judge for
yourself. You see that target over there? He
shall shoot an arrow at it. Dear boy,” he went
on aloud, “his Adiposity would like to see you
shoot. Bring his Highness’ bow and arrows!”</p>
<p>Uggug looked very sulky as he received the
bow and arrow, and prepared to shoot. Just as
the arrow left the bow, the Vice-Warden trod
heavily on the toe of the Baron, who yelled
with the pain.</p>
<p>“Ten thousand pardons!” he exclaimed. “I
stepped back in my excitement. See! It is a
bull’s-eye!”</p>
<p>The Baron gazed in astonishment. “He held
the bow so awkwardly, it seemed impossible!”
he muttered. But there was no room for doubt:
<span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
there was the arrow, right in the centre of the
bull’s-eye!</p>
<p>“The lake is close by,” continued the Vice-Warden.
“Bring his Highness’ fishing-rod!”
And Uggug most unwillingly held the rod, and
dangled the fly over the water.</p>
<p>“A beetle on your arm!” cried my Lady,
pinching the poor Baron’s arm worse than if
ten lobsters had seized it at once. “<i>That</i> kind
is poisonous,” she explained. “But <i>what</i> a
pity! You missed seeing the fish pulled out!”</p>
<p>An enormous dead cod-fish was lying on the
bank, with the hook in its mouth.</p>
<p>“I had always fancied,” the Baron faltered,
“that cod were <i>salt</i>-water fish?”</p>
<p>“Not in <i>this</i> country,” said the Vice-Warden.
“Shall we go in? Ask my son some question
on the way—<i>any</i> subject you like!” And the
sulky boy was violently shoved forwards, to
walk at the Baron’s side.</p>
<p>“Could your Highness tell me,” the Baron
cautiously began, “how much seven times nine
would come to?”</p>
<p>“Turn to the left!” cried the Vice-Warden,
hastily stepping forwards to show the way—so
<span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
hastily, that he ran against his unfortunate
guest, who fell heavily on his face.</p>
<p>“<i>So</i> sorry!” my Lady exclaimed, as she and
her husband helped him to his feet again. “My
son was in the act of saying ‘sixty-three’ as
you fell!”</p>
<p>The Baron said nothing: he was covered
with dust, and seemed much hurt, both in body
and mind. However, when they had got him
into the house, and given him a good brushing,
matters looked a little better.</p>
<p>Dinner was served in due course, and every
fresh dish seemed to increase the good-humour
of the Baron: but all efforts, to get him to
express his opinion as to Uggug’s cleverness,
were in vain, until that interesting youth had
left the room, and was seen from the open
window, prowling about the lawn with a little
basket, which he was filling with frogs.</p>
<p>“So fond of Natural History as he is, dear
boy!” said the doting mother. “Now <i>do</i> tell
us, Baron, what you think of him!”</p>
<p>“To be perfectly candid,” said the cautious
Baron, “I would like a <i>little</i> more evidence.
I think you mentioned his skill in——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>“Music?” said the Vice-Warden. “Why,
he’s simply a prodigy! You shall hear him
play the piano.” And he walked to the window.
“Ug——I mean my boy! Come in for
a minute, <i>and bring the music-master with you</i>!
To turn over the music for him,” he added as
an explanation.</p>
<p>Uggug, having filled his basket with frogs,
had no objection to obey, and soon appeared
in the room, followed by a fierce-looking little
man, who asked the Vice-Warden “Vot music
vill you haf?”</p>
<p>“The Sonata that His Highness plays so
charmingly,” said the Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>“His Highness haf not——” the music-master
began, but was sharply stopped by the
Vice-Warden.</p>
<p>“Silence, Sir! Go and turn over the music
for his Highness. My dear,” (to the Wardeness)
“will you show him what to do?
And meanwhile, Baron, I’ll just show you a
most interesting map we have—of Outland,
and Fairyland, and that sort of thing.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<div class="img" id="fig14">
<img src="images/i096.jpg" alt="THE MAP OF FAIRYLAND" width="500" height="331" />
<p class="center small">THE MAP OF FAIRYLAND</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>By the time my Lady had returned, from
explaining things to the music-master, the map
had been hung up, and the Baron was already
much bewildered by the Vice-Warden’s habit
of pointing to one place while he shouted out
the name of another.</p>
<p>My Lady joining in, pointing out other places,
and shouting other names, only made matters
worse; and at last the Baron, in despair,
took to pointing out places for himself, and
feebly asked “Is that great yellow splotch
<i>Fairyland</i>?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s Fairyland,” said the Vice-Warden:
“and you might as well give him a
hint,” he muttered to my Lady, “about going
back to-morrow. He eats like a shark! It
would hardly do for <i>me</i> to mention it.”</p>
<p>His wife caught the idea, and at once began
giving hints of the most subtle and delicate
kind. “Just see what a short way it is back
to Fairyland! Why, if you started to-morrow
morning, you’d get there in very little more
than a week!”</p>
<p>The Baron looked incredulous. “It took
me a full month to <i>come</i>,” he said.</p>
<p>“But it’s ever so much shorter, going <i>back</i>,
you know!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>The Baron looked appealingly to the Vice-Warden,
who chimed in readily. “You can go
back <i>five</i> times, in the time it took you to come
here <i>once</i>—if you start to-morrow morning!”</p>
<p>All this time the Sonata was pealing through
the room. The Baron could not help admitting
to himself that it was being magnificently
played: but he tried in vain to get a glimpse of
the youthful performer. Every time he had
nearly succeeded in catching sight of him, either
the Vice-Warden or his wife was sure to get in
the way, pointing out some new place on the
map, and deafening him with some new name.</p>
<p>He gave in at last, wished a hasty good-night,
and left the room, while his host and
hostess interchanged looks of triumph.</p>
<p>“Deftly done!” cried the Vice-Warden.
“Craftily contrived! But what means all that
tramping on the stairs?” He half-opened the
door, looked out, and added in a tone of dismay,
“The Baron’s boxes are being carried down!”</p>
<p>“And what means all that rumbling of
wheels?” cried my Lady. She peeped through
the window curtains. “The Baron’s carriage
has come round!” she groaned.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>At this moment the door opened: a fat,
furious face looked in: a voice, hoarse with
passion, thundered out the words “My room is
full of frogs—I leave you!”: and the door
closed again.</p>
<p>And still the noble Sonata went pealing
through the room: but it was <i>Arthur’s</i> masterly
touch that roused the echoes, and thrilled
my very soul with the tender music of the
immortal ‘Sonata Pathetique’: and it was not
till the last note had died away that the tired
but happy traveler could bring himself to
utter the words “good-night!” and to seek his
much-needed pillow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><span class="small">A RIDE ON A LION.</span></h2>
<p>The next day glided away, pleasantly
enough, partly in settling myself in my new
quarters, and partly in strolling round the
neighbourhood, under Arthur’s guidance, and
trying to form a general idea of Elveston and
its inhabitants. When five o’clock arrived,
Arthur proposed—without any embarrassment
this time—to take me with him up to ‘the
Hall,’ in order that I might make acquaintance
with the Earl of Ainslie, who had taken it for
the season, and renew acquaintance with his
daughter Lady Muriel.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>My first impressions of the gentle, dignified,
and yet genial old man were entirely favourable:
and the <i>real</i> satisfaction that showed
itself on his daughter’s face, as she met me with
the words “this is indeed an unlooked-for
pleasure!”, was very soothing for whatever
remains of personal vanity the failures and
disappointments of many long years, and much
buffeting with a rough world, had left in me.</p>
<p>Yet I noted, and was glad to note, evidence
of a far deeper feeling than mere friendly
regard, in her meeting with Arthur—though
this was, as I gathered, an almost daily occurrence—and
the conversation between them, in
which the Earl and I were only occasional
sharers, had an ease and a spontaneity rarely
met with except between <i>very</i> old friends: and,
as I knew that they had not known each other
for a longer period than the summer which
was now rounding into autumn, I felt certain
that ‘Love,’ and Love alone, could explain the
phenomenon.</p>
<p>“How convenient it would be,” Lady Muriel
laughingly remarked, <i>à propos</i> of my having insisted
on saving her the trouble of carrying a
<span class="pb" id="Page_102">102</span>
cup of tea across the room to the Earl, “if
cups of tea had no weight at all! Then perhaps
ladies would <i>sometimes</i> be permitted to
carry them for short distances!”</p>
<p>“One can easily imagine a situation,” said
Arthur, “where things would <i>necessarily</i> have
no weight, relatively to each other, though each
would have its usual weight, looked at by
itself.”</p>
<p>“Some desperate paradox!” said the Earl.
“Tell us how it could be. We shall never
guess it.”</p>
<p>“Well, suppose this house, just as it is,
placed a few billion miles above a planet, and
with nothing else near enough to disturb it: of
course it falls <i>to</i> the planet?”</p>
<p>The Earl nodded. “Of course—though it
might take some centuries to do it.”</p>
<p>“And is five-o’clock-tea to be going on all
the while?” said Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>“That, and other things,” said Arthur. “The
inhabitants would live their lives, grow up and
die, and still the house would be falling, falling,
falling! But now as to the relative weight of
things. Nothing can be <i>heavy</i>, you know,
<span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
except by <i>trying</i> to fall, and being prevented
from doing so. You all grant that?”</p>
<p>We all granted that.</p>
<p>“Well, now, if I take this book, and hold it
out at arms length, of course I feel its <i>weight</i>.
It is trying to fall, and I prevent it. And, if I
let go, it falls to the floor. But, if we were all
falling together, it couldn’t be <i>trying</i> to fall any
quicker, you know: for, if I let go, what more
could it do than fall? And, as my hand would
be falling too—at the same rate—it would
never leave it, for that would be to get ahead of
it in the race. And it could never overtake the
falling floor!”</p>
<p>“I see it clearly,” said Lady Muriel. “But
it makes one dizzy to think of such things!
How <i>can</i> you make us do it?”</p>
<p>“There is a more curious idea yet,” I ventured
to say. “Suppose a cord fastened to the
house, from below, and pulled down by some
one on the planet. Then of course the <i>house</i>
goes faster than its natural rate of falling: but
the furniture—with our noble selves—would
go on falling at their old pace, and would
therefore be left behind.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>“Practically, we should rise to the ceiling,”
said the Earl. “The inevitable result of which
would be concussion of brain.”</p>
<p>“To avoid that,” said Arthur, “let us have
the furniture fixed to the floor, and ourselves
tied down to the furniture. Then the five-o’clock-tea
could go on in peace.”</p>
<p>“With one little drawback!” Lady Muriel
gaily interrupted. “We should take the <i>cups</i>
down with us: but what about the <i>tea</i>?”</p>
<p>“I had forgotten the <i>tea</i>,” Arthur confessed.
“<i>That</i>, no doubt, would rise to the ceiling—unless
you chose to drink it on the way!”</p>
<p>“Which, I think, is <i>quite</i> nonsense enough
for one while!” said the Earl. “What news
does this gentleman bring us from the great
world of London?”</p>
<p>This drew <i>me</i> into the conversation, which
now took a more conventional tone. After a
while, Arthur gave the signal for our departure,
and in the cool of the evening we strolled
down to the beach, enjoying the silence, broken
only by the murmur of the sea and the far-away
music of some fishermen’s song, almost as much
as our late pleasant talk.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>We sat down among the rocks, by a little
pool, so rich in animal, vegetable, and zoöphytic—or
whatever is the right word—life, that I
became entranced in the study of it, and, when
Arthur proposed returning to our lodgings, I
begged to be left there for a while, to watch and
muse alone.</p>
<p>The fishermen’s song grew ever nearer and
clearer, as their boat stood in for the beach;
and I would have gone down to see them land
their cargo of fish, had not the microcosm at
my feet stirred my curiosity yet more keenly.</p>
<p>One ancient crab, that was for ever shuffling
frantically from side to side of the pool, had
particularly fascinated me: there was a vacancy
in its stare, and an aimless violence in its
behaviour, that irresistibly recalled the Gardener
who had befriended Sylvie and Bruno:
and, as I gazed, I caught the concluding notes
of the tune of his crazy song.</p>
<p>The silence that followed was broken by the
sweet voice of Sylvie. “Would you please let
us out into the road?”</p>
<p>“What! After that old beggar again?” the
Gardener yelled, and began singing:—</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He thought he saw a Kangaroo</p>
<p class="t">That worked a coffee-mill:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Vegetable-Pill.</p>
<p class="t0">‘Were I to swallow this,’ he said,</p>
<p class="t">‘I should be very ill!’”</p>
</div>
<p>“We don’t want him to swallow <i>anything</i>,”
Sylvie explained. “He’s not hungry. But we
want to see him. So will you please——”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/i106.jpg" alt="‘HE THOUGHT HE SAW A KANGAROO’" width="500" height="481" />
<p class="center small">‘HE THOUGHT HE SAW A KANGAROO’</p>
</div>
<p>“Certainly!” the Gardener promptly replied.
“I <i>always</i> please. Never displeases nobody.
<span class="pb" id="Page_107">107</span>
There you are!” And he flung the door open,
and let us out upon the dusty high-road.</p>
<p>We soon found our way to the bush, which
had so mysteriously sunk into the ground: and
here Sylvie drew the Magic Locket from its
hiding-place, turned it over with a thoughtful
air, and at last appealed to Bruno in a rather
helpless way. “What <i>was</i> it we had to do with
it, Bruno? It’s all gone out of my head!”</p>
<p>“Kiss it!” was Bruno’s invariable recipe in
cases of doubt and difficulty. Sylvie kissed it,
but no result followed.</p>
<p>“Rub it the wrong way,” was Bruno’s next
suggestion.</p>
<p>“Which <i>is</i> the wrong way?” Sylvie most
reasonably enquired. The obvious plan was to
try <i>both</i> ways.</p>
<p>Rubbing from left to right had no visible
effect whatever.</p>
<p>From right to left—“Oh, stop, Sylvie!”
Bruno cried in sudden alarm. “Whatever <i>is</i>
going to happen?”</p>
<p>For a number of trees, on the neighbouring
hillside, were moving slowly upwards, in solemn
procession: while a mild little brook, that had
been rippling at our feet a moment before,
began to swell, and foam, and hiss, and bubble,
in a truly alarming fashion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<div class="img" id="fig16">
<img src="images/i108.jpg" alt="THE MOUSE-LION" width="500" height="321" />
<p class="center small">THE MOUSE-LION</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>“Rub it some other way!” cried Bruno.
“Try up-and-down! Quick!”</p>
<p>It was a happy thought. Up-and-down did
it: and the landscape, which had been showing
signs of mental aberration in various directions,
returned to its normal condition of sobriety—with
the exception of a small yellowish-brown
mouse, which continued to run wildly up and
down the road, lashing its tail like a little lion.</p>
<p>“Let’s follow it,” said Sylvie: and this also
turned out a happy thought. The mouse at
once settled down into a business-like jog-trot,
with which we could easily keep pace. The
only phenomenon, that gave me any uneasiness,
was the rapid increase in the <i>size</i> of the little
creature we were following, which became
every moment more and more like a real lion.</p>
<p>Soon the transformation was complete: and
a noble lion stood patiently waiting for us to
come up with it. No thought of fear seemed to
occur to the children, who patted and stroked
it as if it had been a Shetland-pony.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>“Help me up!” cried Bruno. And in another
moment Sylvie had lifted him upon the broad
back of the gentle beast, and seated herself
behind him, pillion-fashion. Bruno took a good
handful of mane in each hand, and made believe
to guide this new kind of steed. “Gee-up!”
seemed quite sufficient by way of <i>verbal</i> direction:
the lion at once broke into an easy canter,
and we soon found ourselves in the depths
of the forest. I say ‘<i>we</i>,’ for I am certain
that <i>I</i> accompanied them—though <i>how</i> I
managed to keep up with a cantering lion I am
wholly unable to explain. But I was certainly
one of the party when we came upon an old
beggar-man cutting sticks, at whose feet the
lion made a profound obeisance, Sylvie and
Bruno at the same moment dismounting, and
leaping into the arms of their father.</p>
<p>“From bad to worse!” the old man said to
himself, dreamily, when the children had
finished their rather confused account of the
Ambassador’s visit, gathered no doubt from
general report, as they had not seen him themselves.
“From bad to worse! That is their
destiny. I see it, but I cannot alter it. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_111">111</span>
selfishness of a mean and crafty man—the
selfishness of an ambitious and silly woman—the
selfishness of a spiteful and loveless child—all
tend one way, from bad to worse! And
you, my darlings, must suffer it awhile, I fear.
Yet, when things are at their worst, you can
come to me. I can do but little as yet——”</p>
<p>Gathering up a handful of dust and scattering
it in the air, he slowly and solemnly pronounced
some words that sounded like a charm, the
children looking on in awe-struck silence:—</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>The cloud of dust spread itself out through
the air, as if it were alive, forming curious
shapes that were for ever changing into others.</p>
<p>“It makes letters! It makes words!”
Bruno whispered, as he clung, half-frightened,
to Sylvie. “Only I <i>ca’n’t</i> make them out!
Read them, Sylvie!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>“I’ll try,” Sylvie gravely replied. “Wait a
minute—if only I could see that word——”</p>
<p>“I should be very ill!” a discordant voice
yelled in our ears.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“‘Were I to swallow this,’ he said,</p>

<h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
<br /><span class="small">A JESTER AND A BEAR.</span></h2>
<p>Yes, we were in the garden once more: and,
to escape that horrid discordant voice, we
hurried indoors, and found ourselves in the
library—Uggug blubbering, the Professor
standing by with a bewildered air, and my
Lady, with her arms clasped round her son’s
neck, repeating, over and over again, “and <i>did</i>
they give him nasty lessons to learn? My
own pretty pet!”</p>
<p>“What’s all this noise about?” the Vice-Warden
angrily enquired, as he strode into the
room. “And who put the hat-stand here?”
<span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
And he hung his hat up on Bruno, who was
standing in the middle of the room, too much
astonished by the sudden change of scene to
make any attempt at removing it, though it
came down to his shoulders, making him look
something like a small candle with a large
extinguisher over it.</p>
<p>The Professor mildly explained that His
Highness had been graciously pleased to say
he wouldn’t do his lessons.</p>
<p>“Do your lessons this instant, you young
cub!” thundered the Vice-Warden. “And
take <i>this</i>!” and a resounding box on the ear
made the unfortunate Professor reel across
the room.</p>
<p>“Save me!” faltered the poor old man, as
he sank, half-fainting, at my Lady’s feet.</p>
<p>“Shave you? Of course I will!” my Lady
replied, as she lifted him into a chair, and
pinned an anti-macassar round his neck.
“Where’s the razor?”</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden meanwhile had got hold
of Uggug, and was belabouring him with his
umbrella. “Who left this loose nail in the
floor?” he shouted. “Hammer it in, I say!
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>
Hammer it in!” Blow after blow fell on the
writhing Uggug, till he dropped howling to
the floor.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig17">
<img src="images/i115.jpg" alt="‘HAMMER IT IN!’" width="500" height="564" />
<p class="center small">‘HAMMER IT IN!’</p>
</div>
<p>Then his father turned to the ‘shaving’
scene which was being enacted, and roared
with laughter. “Excuse me, dear, I ca’n’t help
it!” he said as soon as he could speak. “You
<i>are</i> such an utter donkey! Kiss me, Tabby!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>And he flung his arms round the neck of the
terrified Professor, who raised a wild shriek,
but whether he received the threatened kiss or
not I was unable to see, as Bruno, who had by
this time released himself from his extinguisher,
rushed headlong out of the room, followed by
Sylvie; and I was so fearful of being left alone
among all these crazy creatures that I hurried
after them.</p>
<p>“We must go to Father!” Sylvie panted, as
they ran down the garden. “I’m <i>sure</i> things
are at their worst! I’ll ask the Gardener to
let us out again.”</p>
<p>“But we ca’n’t <i>walk</i> all the way!” Bruno
whimpered. “How I <i>wiss</i> we had a coach-and-four,
like Uncle!”</p>
<p>And, shrill and wild, rang through the air the
familiar voice:—</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four</p>
<p class="t">That stood beside his bed:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Bear without a Head.</p>
<p class="t0">‘Poor thing,’ he said, ‘poor silly thing!</p>
<p class="t">It’s waiting to be fed!’”</p>
</div>

<p class="center small">A BEAR WITHOUT A HEAD</p>
</div>
<p>“No, I ca’n’t let you out again!” he said,
before the children could speak. “The Vice-Warden
gave it me, he did, for letting you
out last time! So be off with you!” And,
turning away from them, he began digging
frantically in the middle of a gravel-walk,
singing, over and over again,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“‘Poor thing,’ he said, ‘poor silly thing!</p>
<p class="t">It’s waiting to be fed!’”</p>
</div>
<p>but in a more musical tone than the shrill
screech in which he had begun.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>The music grew fuller and richer at every
moment: other manly voices joined in the
refrain: and soon I heard the heavy thud that
told me the boat had touched the beach, and
the harsh grating of the shingle as the men
dragged it up. I roused myself, and, after
lending them a hand in hauling up their boat,
I lingered yet awhile to watch them disembark
a goodly assortment of the hard-won ‘treasures
of the deep.’</p>
<p>When at last I reached our lodgings I was
tired and sleepy, and glad enough to settle
down again into the easy-chair, while Arthur
hospitably went to his cupboard, to get me
out some cake and wine, without which, he
declared, he could not, as a doctor, permit
my going to bed.</p>
<p>And how that cupboard-door <i>did</i> creak! It
surely could not be <i>Arthur</i>, who was opening
and shutting it so often, moving so restlessly
about, and muttering like the soliloquy of a
tragedy-queen!</p>
<p>No, it was a <i>female</i> voice. Also the figure—half-hidden
by the cupboard-door—was a
<i>female</i> figure, massive, and in flowing robes.
<span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
Could it be the landlady? The door opened,
and a strange man entered the room.</p>
<p>“What <i>is</i> that donkey doing?” he said to
himself, pausing, aghast, on the threshold.</p>
<p>The lady, thus rudely referred to, was his
wife. She had got one of the cupboards open,
and stood with her back to him, smoothing
down a sheet of brown paper on one of the
shelves, and whispering to herself “So, so!
Deftly done! Craftily contrived!”</p>
<p>Her loving husband stole behind her on tiptoe,
and tapped her on the head. “Boh!” he
playfully shouted at her ear. “Never tell me
again I ca’n’t say ‘boh’ to a goose!”</p>
<p>My Lady wrung her hands. “Discovered!”
she groaned. “Yet no—he is one of us!
Reveal it not, oh Man! Let it bide its time!”</p>
<p>“Reveal <i>what</i> not?” her husband testily
replied, dragging out the sheet of brown paper.
“What are you hiding here, my Lady? I
insist upon knowing!”</p>
<p>My Lady cast down her eyes, and spoke in
the littlest of little voices. “Don’t make fun of
it, Benjamin!” she pleaded. “It’s—it’s—don’t
you understand? It’s a <span class="small">DAGGER</span>!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>“And what’s <i>that</i> for?” sneered His Excellency.
“We’ve only got to make people <i>think</i>
he’s dead! We haven’t got to <i>kill</i> him! And
made of tin, too!” he snarled, contemptuously
bending the blade round his thumb. “Now,
Madam, you’ll be good enough to explain.
First, what do you call me <i>Benjamin</i> for?”</p>
<p>“It’s part of the Conspiracy, Love! One
<i>must</i> have an alias, you know——”</p>
<p>“Oh, an <i>alias</i>, is it? Well! And next,
what did you get this dagger for? Come, no
evasions! You ca’n’t deceive <i>me</i>!”</p>
<p>“I got it for—for—for——” the detected
Conspirator stammered, trying her best to put
on the assassin-expression that she had been
practising at the looking-glass. “For——”</p>
<p>“For <i>what</i>, Madam!”</p>
<p>“Well, for eighteenpence, if you <i>must</i> know,
dearest! That’s what I got it for, on my——”</p>
<p>“Now <i>don’t</i> say your Word and Honour!”
groaned the other Conspirator. “Why, they
aren’t worth half the money, put together!”</p>
<p>“On my <i>birthday</i>,” my Lady concluded in a
meek whisper. “One <i>must</i> have a dagger, you
know. It’s part of the——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>“Oh, don’t talk of Conspiracies!” her husband
savagely interrupted, as he tossed the
dagger into the cupboard. “You know about
as much how to manage a Conspiracy as if
you were a chicken. Why, the first thing is
to get a disguise. Now, just look at this!”</p>
<p>And with pardonable pride he fitted on the
cap and bells, and the rest of the Fool’s dress,
and winked at her, and put his tongue in his
cheek. “Is <i>that</i> the sort of thing, now?” he
demanded.</p>
<p>My Lady’s eyes flashed with all a Conspirator’s
enthusiasm. “The very thing!” she
exclaimed, clapping her hands. “You do look,
oh, such a <i>perfect</i> Fool!”</p>
<p>The Fool smiled a doubtful smile. He was
not quite clear whether it was a compliment
or not, to express it so plainly. “You mean
a Jester? Yes, that’s what I intended. And
what do you think <i>your</i> disguise is to be?”
And he proceeded to unfold the parcel, the
lady watching him in rapture.</p>
<p>“Oh, how lovely!” she cried, when at last
the dress was unfolded. “What a <i>splendid</i>
disguise! An Esquimaux peasant-woman!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>“An Esquimaux peasant, indeed!” growled
the other. “Here, put it on, and look at yourself
in the glass. Why, it’s a <i>Bear</i>, ca’n’t you
use your eyes?” He checked himself suddenly,
as a harsh voice yelled through the room</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Bear without a Head!”</p>
</div>
<p>But it was only the Gardener, singing under
the open window. The Vice-Warden stole on
tip-toe to the window, and closed it noiselessly,
before he ventured to go on. “Yes, Lovey, a
<i>Bear</i>: but not without a <i>head</i>, I hope! You’re
the Bear, and me the Keeper. And if any one
knows us, they’ll have sharp eyes, that’s all!”</p>
<p>“I shall have to practise the steps a bit,” my
Lady said, looking out through the Bear’s
mouth: “one ca’n’t help being rather human
just at first, you know. And of course you’ll
say ‘Come up, Bruin!’, won’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course,” replied the Keeper, laying
hold of the chain, that hung from the Bear’s
collar, with one hand, while with the other he
cracked a little whip. “Now go round the
room in a sort of a dancing attitude. Very
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
good, my dear, very good. Come up, Bruin!
Come up, I say!”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig19">
<img src="images/i123.jpg" alt="‘COME UP, BRUIN!’" width="500" height="471" />
<p class="center small">‘COME UP, BRUIN!’</p>
</div>
<p>He roared out the last words for the benefit
of Uggug, who had just come into the room,
and was now standing, with his hands spread
out, and eyes and mouth wide open, the very
picture of stupid amazement. “Oh, my!” was
all he could gasp out.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>The Keeper pretended to be adjusting the
bear’s collar, which gave him an opportunity of
whispering, unheard by Uggug, “<i>my</i> fault, I’m
afraid! Quite forgot to fasten the door. Plot’s
ruined if <i>he</i> finds it out! Keep it up a minute
or two longer. Be savage!” Then, while
seeming to pull it back with all his strength, he
let it advance upon the scared boy: my Lady,
with admirable presence of mind, kept up what
she no doubt intended for a savage growl,
though it was more like the purring of a cat:
and Uggug backed out of the room with such
haste that he tripped over the mat, and was
heard to fall heavily outside—an accident
to which even his doting mother paid no heed,
in the excitement of the moment.</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden shut and bolted the door.
“Off with the disguises!” he panted. “There’s
not a moment to lose. He’s sure to fetch the
Professor, and we couldn’t take <i>him</i> in, you
know!” And in another minute the disguises
were stowed away in the cupboard, the door
unbolted, and the two Conspirators seated
lovingly side-by-side on the sofa, earnestly
discussing a book the Vice-Warden had hastily
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
snatched off the table, which proved to be the
City-Directory of the capital of Outland.</p>
<p>The door opened, very slowly and cautiously,
and the Professor peeped in, Uggug’s stupid
face being just visible behind him.</p>
<p>“It is a beautiful arrangement!” the Vice-Warden
was saying with enthusiasm. “You
see, my precious one, that there are fifteen
houses in Green Street, <i>before</i> you turn into
West Street.”</p>
<p>“<i>Fifteen</i> houses! Is it <i>possible</i>?” my Lady
replied. “I thought it was fourteen!” And,
so intent were they on this interesting question,
that neither of them even looked up till the
Professor, leading Uggug by the hand, stood
close before them.</p>
<p>My Lady was the first to notice their approach.
“Why, here’s the Professor!” she
exclaimed in her blandest tones. “And my
precious child too! Are lessons over?”</p>
<p>“A strange thing has happened!” the Professor
began in a trembling tone. “His Exalted
Fatness” (this was one of Uggug’s many titles)
“tells me he has just seen, in this very room,
a Dancing-Bear and a Court-Jester!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>The Vice-Warden and his wife shook with
well-acted merriment.</p>
<p>“Not in <i>this</i> room, darling!” said the fond
mother. “We’ve been sitting here this hour
or more, reading——,” here she referred to
the book lying on her lap, “—reading the—the
City-Directory.”</p>
<p>“Let me feel your pulse, my boy!” said the
anxious father. “Now put out your tongue.
Ah, I thought so! He’s a little feverish, Professor,
and has had a bad dream. Put him to
bed at once, and give him a cooling draught.”</p>
<p>“I ain’t been dreaming!” his Exalted Fatness
remonstrated, as the Professor led him away.</p>
<p>“Bad grammar, Sir!” his father remarked
with some sternness. “Kindly attend to <i>that</i>
little matter, Professor, as soon as you have
corrected the feverishness. And, by the way,
Professor!” (The Professor left his distinguished
pupil standing at the door, and meekly
returned.) “There is a rumour afloat, that the
people wish to elect an—in point of fact, an—you
understand that I mean an——”</p>
<p>“Not <i>another Professor</i>!” the poor old man
exclaimed in horror.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>“No! Certainly not!” the Vice-Warden
eagerly explained. “Merely an <i>Emperor</i>, you
understand.”</p>
<p>“An <i>Emperor</i>!” cried the astonished Professor,
holding his head between his hands, as
if he expected it to come to pieces with the
shock. “What will the Warden——”</p>
<p>“Why, the <i>Warden</i> will most likely <i>be</i> the
new Emperor!” my Lady explained. “Where
could we find a better? Unless, perhaps——”
she glanced at her husband.</p>
<p>“Where indeed!” the Professor fervently
responded, quite failing to take the hint.</p>
<p>The Vice-Warden resumed the thread of his
discourse. “The reason I mentioned it, Professor,
was to ask <i>you</i> to be so kind as to
preside at the Election. You see it would
make the thing <i>respectable</i>—no suspicion of
anything underhand——”</p>
<p>“I fear I ca’n’t, your Excellency!” the old
man faltered. “What will the Warden——”</p>
<p>“True, true!” the Vice-Warden interrupted.
“Your position, as Court-Professor, makes it
awkward, I admit. Well, well! Then the
Election shall be held without you.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>“Better so, than if it were held <i>within</i> me!”
the Professor murmured with a bewildered air,
as if he hardly knew what he was saying.
“Bed, I think your Highness said, and a cooling-draught?”
And he wandered dreamily
back to where Uggug sulkily awaited him.</p>
<p>I followed them out of the room, and down
the passage, the Professor murmuring to himself,
all the time, as a kind of aid to his feeble
memory, “C, C, C; Couch, Cooling-Draught,
Correct-Grammar,” till, in turning a corner,
he met Sylvie and Bruno, so suddenly that
the startled Professor let go of his fat pupil,
who instantly took to his heels.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
<br /><span class="small">THE OTHER PROFESSOR.</span></h2>
<p>“We were looking for you!” cried Sylvie,
in a tone of great relief. “We <i>do</i> want you
so much, you ca’n’t think!”</p>
<p>“What is it, dear children?” the Professor
asked, beaming on them with a very different
look from what Uggug ever got from him.</p>
<p>“We want you to speak to the Gardener for
us,” Sylvie said, as she and Bruno took the old
man’s hands and led him into the hall.</p>
<p>“He’s ever so unkind!” Bruno mournfully
added. “They’s <i>all</i> unkind to us, now that
Father’s gone. The Lion were <i>much</i> nicer!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>“But you must explain to me, please,” the
Professor said with an anxious look, “<i>which</i>
is the Lion, and <i>which</i> is the Gardener. It’s
<i>most</i> important not to get two such animals
confused together. And one’s very liable to
do it in their case—both having mouths,
you know——”</p>
<p>“Doos oo <i>always</i> confuses two animals together?”
Bruno asked.</p>
<p>“Pretty often, I’m afraid,” the Professor candidly
confessed. “Now, for instance, there’s
the rabbit-hutch and the hall-clock.” The Professor
pointed them out. “One gets a little
confused with <i>them</i>—both having doors, you
know. Now, only yesterday—would you believe
it?—I put some lettuces into the clock,
and tried to wind up the rabbit!”</p>
<p>“Did the rabbit <i>go</i>, after oo wounded it
up?” said Bruno.</p>
<p>The Professor clasped his hands on the top
of his head, and groaned. “Go? I should
think it <i>did</i> go! Why, it’s <i>gone</i>! And where
ever it’s gone to—that’s what I <i>ca’n’t</i> find out!
I’ve done my best—I’ve read all the article
‘Rabbit’ in the great dictionary—— Come in!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>“Only the tailor, Sir, with your little bill,”
said a meek voice outside the door.</p>
<p>“Ah, well, I can soon settle <i>his</i> business,”
the Professor said to the children, “if you’ll
just wait a minute. How much is it, this year,
my man?” The tailor had come in while he
was speaking.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s been a doubling so many years,
you see,” the tailor replied, a little gruffly, “and
I think I’d like the money now. It’s two
thousand pound, it is!”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s nothing!” the Professor carelessly
remarked, feeling in his pocket, as if he
always carried at least <i>that</i> amount about with
him. “But wouldn’t you like to wait just
another year, and make it <i>four</i> thousand?
Just think how rich you’d be! Why, you
might be a <i>King</i>, if you liked!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know as I’d care about being a
<i>King</i>,” the man said thoughtfully. “But it
<i>dew</i> sound a powerful sight o’ money! Well,
I think I’ll wait——”</p>
<p>“Of course you will!” said the Professor.
“There’s good sense in <i>you</i>, I see. Good-day
to you, my man!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>“Will you ever have to pay him that four
thousand pounds?” Sylvie asked as the door
closed on the departing creditor.</p>
<p>“<i>Never</i>, my child!” the Professor replied
emphatically. “He’ll go on doubling it, till
he dies. You see it’s <i>always</i> worth while
waiting another year, to get twice as much
money! And now what would you like to
do, my little friends? Shall I take you to see
the Other Professor? This would be an excellent
opportunity for a visit,“ he said to himself,
glancing at his watch: “he generally takes
a short rest—of fourteen minutes and a half—about
this time.”</p>
<p>Bruno hastily went round to Sylvie, who
was standing at the other side of the Professor,
and put his hand into hers. “I <i>thinks</i> we’d
like to go,” he said doubtfully: “only please
let’s go all together. It’s best to be on the
safe side, oo know!”</p>
<p>“Why, you talk as if you were <i>Sylvie</i>!”
exclaimed the Professor.</p>
<p>“I know I did,” Bruno replied very humbly.
“I quite forgotted I wasn’t Sylvie. Only I
fought he might be rarver fierce!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>The Professor laughed a jolly laugh. “Oh,
he’s quite tame!” he said. “He never bites.
He’s only a little—a little <i>dreamy</i>, you know.”
He took hold of Bruno’s other hand, and led
the children down a long passage I had never
noticed before—not that there was anything
remarkable in <i>that</i>: I was constantly coming
on new rooms and passages in that mysterious
Palace, and very seldom succeeded in finding
the old ones again.</p>
<p>Near the end of the passage the Professor
stopped. “This is his room,” he said, pointing
to the solid wall.</p>
<p>“We ca’n’t get in through <i>there</i>!” Bruno
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Sylvie said nothing, till she had carefully
examined whether the wall opened anywhere.
Then she laughed merrily: “You’re playing
us a trick, you dear old thing!” she said.
“There’s no <i>door</i> here!”</p>
<p>“There isn’t any door to the room,” said
the Professor. “We shall have to climb in at
the window.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<div class="img" id="fig20">
<img src="images/i134.jpg" alt="THE OTHER PROFESSOR" width="500" height="325" />
<p class="center small">THE OTHER PROFESSOR</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<p>So we went into the garden, and soon
found the window of the Other Professor’s
room. It was a ground-floor window, and
stood invitingly open: the Professor first
lifted the two children in, and then he and I
climbed in after them.</p>
<p>The Other Professor was seated at a table,
with a large book open before him, on which
his forehead was resting: he had clasped his
arms round the book, and was snoring heavily.
“He usually reads like that,” the Professor
remarked, “when the book’s very interesting:
and then sometimes it’s very difficult to get
him to attend!”</p>
<p>This seemed to be one of the difficult times:
the Professor lifted him up, once or twice, and
shook him violently: but he always returned
to his book the moment he was let go of, and
showed by his heavy breathing that the book
was as interesting as ever.</p>
<p>“How dreamy he is!” the Professor exclaimed.
“He must have got to a <i>very</i>
interesting part of the book!” And he rained
quite a shower of thumps on the Other Professor’s
back, shouting “Hoy! Hoy!” all the
time. “Isn’t it <i>wonderful</i> that he should be
so dreamy?” he said to Bruno.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<p>“If he’s always as <i>sleepy</i> as that,” Bruno
remarked, “a <i>course</i> he’s dreamy!”</p>
<p>“But what are we to <i>do</i>?” said the Professor.
“You see he’s quite wrapped up in
the book!”</p>
<p>“Suppose oo <i>shuts</i> the book?” Bruno suggested.</p>
<p>“That’s it!” cried the delighted Professor.
“Of course that’ll do it!” And he shut up the
book so quickly that he caught the Other Professor’s
nose between the leaves, and gave it a
severe pinch.</p>
<p>The Other Professor instantly rose to his
feet, and carried the book away to the end of
the room, where he put it back in its place in
the book-case. “I’ve been reading for eighteen
hours and three-quarters,” he said, “and now
I shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half.
Is the Lecture all ready?”</p>
<p>“Very nearly,” the Professor humbly replied.
“I shall ask you to give me a hint or two—there
will be a few little difficulties——”</p>
<p>“And a Banquet, I think you said?”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes! The Banquet comes <i>first</i>, of
course. People never enjoy Abstract Science,
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
you know, when they’re ravenous with hunger.
And then there’s the Fancy-Dress-Ball. Oh,
there’ll be lots of entertainment!”</p>
<p>“Where will the Ball come in?” said the
Other Professor.</p>
<p>“I <i>think</i> it had better come at the beginning
of the Banquet—it brings people together so
nicely, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s the right order. First the Meeting:
then the Eating: then the Treating—for
I’m sure any Lecture <i>you</i> give us will be a
treat!” said the Other Professor, who had
been standing with his back to us all this time,
occupying himself in taking the books out, one
by one, and turning them upside-down. An
easel, with a black board on it, stood near
him: and, every time that he turned a book
upside-down, he made a mark on the board
with a piece of chalk.</p>
<p>“And as to the ‘Pig-Tale’—which <i>you</i>
have so kindly promised to give us—” the
Professor went on, thoughtfully rubbing his
chin. “I think that had better come at the
<i>end</i> of the Banquet: then people can listen to
it quietly.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
<p>“Shall I <i>sing</i> it?” the Other Professor asked,
with a smile of delight.</p>
<p>“If you <i>can</i>,” the Professor replied, cautiously.</p>
<p>“Let me try,” said the Other Professor,
seating himself at the pianoforte. “For the
sake of argument, let us assume that it begins
on A flat.” And he struck the note in question.
“La, la, la! I think that’s within an octave of
it.” He struck the note again, and appealed to
Bruno, who was standing at his side. “Did I
sing it like <i>that</i>, my child?”</p>
<p>“No, oo didn’t,” Bruno replied with great
decision. “It were more like a duck.”</p>
<p>“Single notes are apt to have that effect,”
the Other Professor said with a sigh. “Let
me try a whole verse.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There was a Pig, that sat alone,</p>
<p class="t">Beside a ruined Pump.</p>
<p class="t0">By day and night he made his moan:</p>
<p class="t0">It would have stirred a heart of stone</p>
<p class="t0">To see him wring his hoofs and groan,</p>
<p class="t">Because he could not jump.</p>
</div>
<p>Would you call that a tune, Professor?” he
asked, when he had finished.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The Professor considered a little. “Well,”
he said at last, “some of the notes are the
same as others—and some are different—but
I should hardly call it a <i>tune</i>.”</p>
<p>“Let me try it a bit by myself,” said the
Other Professor. And he began touching the
notes here and there, and humming to himself
like an angry bluebottle.</p>
<p>“How do you like his singing?” the Professor
asked the children in a low voice.</p>
<p>“It isn’t very <i>beautiful</i>,” Sylvie said,
hesitatingly.</p>
<p>“It’s very extremely <i>ugly</i>!” Bruno said,
without any hesitation at all.</p>
<p>“All extremes are bad,” the Professor said,
very gravely. “For instance, Sobriety is a
very good thing, when practised <i>in moderation</i>:
but even Sobriety, when carried to an <i>extreme</i>,
has its disadvantages.”</p>
<p>“What are its disadvantages?” was the
question that rose in my mind—and, as usual,
Bruno asked it for me. “What <i>are</i> its lizard
bandages?”</p>
<p>“Well, this is <i>one</i> of them,” said the Professor.
“When a man’s tipsy (that’s one extreme,
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
you know), he sees one thing as two.
But, when he’s <i>extremely</i> sober (that’s the other
extreme), he sees two things as one. It’s
equally inconvenient, whichever happens.”</p>
<p>“What does ‘illconvenient’ mean?” Bruno
whispered to Sylvie.</p>
<p>“The difference between ‘convenient’ and
‘inconvenient’ is best explained by an example,”
said the Other Professor, who had
overheard the question. “If you’ll just think
over any Poem that contains the two words—such
as——”</p>
<p>The Professor put his hands over his ears,
with a look of dismay. “If you once let him
begin a <i>Poem</i>,” he said to Sylvie, “he’ll never
leave off again! He never does!”</p>
<p>“Did he ever begin a Poem and not leave
off again?” Sylvie enquired.</p>
<p>“Three times,” said the Professor.</p>
<p>Bruno raised himself on tiptoe, till his lips
were on a level with Sylvie’s ear. “What
became of them three Poems?” he whispered.
“Is he saying them all, now?”</p>
<p>“Hush!” said Sylvie. “The Other Professor
is speaking!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>“I’ll say it very quick,” murmured the Other
Professor, with downcast eyes, and melancholy
voice, which contrasted oddly with his face,
as he had forgotten to leave off smiling. (“At
least it wasn’t exactly a <i>smile</i>,” as Sylvie said
afterwards: “it looked as if his mouth was
made that shape.”)</p>
<p>“Go on then,” said the Professor. “<i>What
must be must be.</i>”</p>
<p>“Remember that!” Sylvie whispered to
Bruno, “It’s a very good rule for whenever
you hurt yourself.”</p>
<p>“And it’s a very good rule for whenever I
make a noise,” said the saucy little fellow.
“So <i>you</i> remember it too, Miss!”</p>
<p>“Whatever <i>do</i> you mean?” said Sylvie,
trying to frown, a thing she never managed
particularly well.</p>
<p>“Oftens and oftens,” said Bruno, “haven’t
oo told me ‘There mustn’t be so much noise,
Bruno!’ when I’ve tolded oo ‘There <i>must</i>!’
Why, there isn’t no rules at all about ‘There
mustn’t’! But oo never believes <i>me</i>!”</p>
<p>“As if any one <i>could</i> believe <i>you</i>, you wicked
wicked boy!” said Sylvie. The <i>words</i> were
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
severe enough, but I am of opinion that, when
you are really <i>anxious</i> to impress a criminal
with a sense of his guilt, you ought not to pronounce
the sentence with your lips <i>quite</i> close
to his cheek—since a kiss at the end of it, however
accidental, weakens the effect terribly.</p>

<p>“As I was saying,” the Other Professor resumed,
“if you’ll just think over any Poem,
that contains the words—such as</p>

<p class="t0">‘Peter is poor,’ said noble Paul,</p>

<p>You’ll see in a moment what the difference
is between ‘convenient’ and ‘inconvenient.’
You quite understand it now, don’t you?” he
added, looking kindly at Bruno, who was sitting,
at Sylvie’s side, on the floor.</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Bruno, very quietly. Such a
short speech was very unusual, for him: but
just then he seemed, I fancied, a little exhausted.
In fact, he climbed up into Sylvie’s
lap as he spoke, and rested his head against
her shoulder. “What a many verses it was!”
he whispered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
<br /><span class="small">A MUSICAL GARDENER.</span></h2>
<p>The Other Professor regarded him with some
anxiety. “The smaller animal ought to go to
bed <i>at once</i>,” he said with an air of authority.</p>
<p>“Why <i>at once</i>?” said the Professor.</p>
<p>“Because he can’t go at twice,” said the
Other Professor.</p>
<p>The Professor gently clapped his hands.
“Isn’t he <i>wonderful</i>!” he said to Sylvie.
“Nobody else could have thought of the
reason, so quick. Why, <i>of course</i> he ca’n’t
go at twice! It would hurt him to be
divided.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
<p>This remark woke up Bruno, suddenly and
completely. “I don’t want to be <i>divided</i>,” he
said decisively.</p>
<p>“It does very well on a <i>diagram</i>,” said the
Other Professor. “I could show it you in a
minute, only the chalk’s a little blunt.”</p>
<p>“Take care!” Sylvie anxiously exclaimed,
as he began, rather clumsily, to point it.
“You’ll cut your finger off, if you hold the
knife so!”</p>
<p>“If oo cuts it off, will oo give it to <i>me</i>,
please?” Bruno thoughtfully added.</p>
<p>“It’s like this,” said the Other Professor,
hastily drawing a long line upon the black
board, and marking the letters ‘<i>A</i>,’ ‘<i>B</i>,’ at
the two ends, and ‘<i>C</i>’ in the middle: “let
me explain it to you. If <i>AB</i> were to be
divided into two parts at <i>C</i>——”</p>
<p>“It would be drownded,” Bruno pronounced
confidently.</p>
<p>The Other Professor gasped. “<i>What</i> would
be drownded?”</p>
<p>“Why the bumble-bee, of course!” said
Bruno. “And the two bits would sink down
in the sea!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
<p>Here the Professor interfered, as the Other
Professor was evidently too much puzzled to
go on with his diagram.</p>
<p>“When I said it would <i>hurt</i> him, I was merely
referring to the action of the nerves——”</p>
<p>The Other Professor brightened up in a
moment. “The action of the nerves,” he
began eagerly, “is curiously slow in some
people. I had a friend, once, that, if you
burnt him with a red-hot poker, it would take
years and years before he felt it!”</p>
<p>“And if you only <i>pinched</i> him?” queried
Sylvie.</p>
<p>“Then it would take ever so much longer,
of course. In fact, I doubt if the man <i>himself</i>
would ever feel it, at all. His grandchildren
might.”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t like to be the grandchild of a
pinched grandfather, would <i>you</i>, Mister Sir?”
Bruno whispered. “It might come just when
you wanted to be happy!”</p>
<p>That would be awkward, I admitted, taking
it quite as a matter of course that he had so
suddenly caught sight of me. “But don’t you
<i>always</i> want to be happy, Bruno?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>“Not <i>always</i>,” Bruno said thoughtfully.
“Sometimes, when I’s <i>too</i> happy, I wants to
be a little miserable. Then I just tell Sylvie
about it, oo know, and Sylvie sets me some
lessons. Then it’s all right.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry you don’t like lessons,” I said.
“You should copy Sylvie. <i>She’s</i> always as
busy as the day is long!”</p>
<p>“Well, so am <i>I</i>!” said Bruno.</p>
<p>“No, no!” Sylvie corrected him. “<i>You’re</i>
as busy as the day is <i>short</i>!”</p>
<p>“Well, what’s the difference?” Bruno asked.
“Mister Sir, isn’t the day as short as it’s
long? I mean, isn’t it the <i>same</i> length?”</p>
<p>Never having considered the question in this
light, I suggested that they had better ask the
Professor; and they ran off in a moment to
appeal to their old friend. The Professor left
off polishing his spectacles to consider. “My
dears,” he said after a minute, “the day is
the same length as anything that is the same
length as <i>it</i>.” And he resumed his neverending
task of polishing.</p>
<p>The children returned, slowly and thoughtfully,
to report his answer. “<i>Isn’t</i> he wise?”
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
Sylvie asked in an awestruck whisper. “If <i>I</i>
was as wise as <i>that</i>, I should have a head-ache
all day long. I <i>know</i> I should!”</p>
<p>“You appear to be talking to somebody—that
isn’t here,” the Professor said, turning
round to the children. “Who is it?”</p>
<p>Bruno looked puzzled. “I never talks to
nobody when he isn’t here!” he replied. “It
isn’t good manners. Oo should always wait
till he comes, before oo talks to him!”</p>
<p>The Professor looked anxiously in my direction,
and seemed to look through and through
me without seeing me. “Then who are you
talking to?” he said. “There isn’t anybody
here, you know, except the Other Professor—and
<i>he</i> isn’t here!” he added wildly,
turning round and round like a teetotum.
“Children! Help to look for him! Quick!
He’s got lost again!”</p>
<p>The children were on their feet in a moment.</p>
<p>“Where shall we look?” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“Anywhere!” shouted the excited Professor.
“Only be quick about it!” And he began
trotting round and round the room, lifting up
the chairs, and shaking them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Bruno took a very small book out of the
bookcase, opened it, and shook it in imitation
of the Professor. “He isn’t <i>here</i>,” he said.</p>
<p>“He <i>ca’n’t</i> be there, Bruno!” Sylvie said
indignantly.</p>
<p>“Course he ca’n’t!” said Bruno. “I should
have shooked him out, if he’d been in there!”</p>
<p>“Has he ever been lost before?” Sylvie
enquired, turning up a corner of the hearth-rug,
and peeping under it.</p>
<p>“Once before,” said the Professor: “he once
lost himself in a wood——”</p>
<p>“And couldn’t he find his-self again?” said
Bruno. “Why didn’t he shout? He’d be
sure to hear his-self, ’cause he couldn’t be far
off, oo know.”</p>
<p>“Let’s try shouting,” said the Professor.</p>
<p>“What shall we shout?” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“On second thoughts, <i>don’t</i> shout,” the
Professor replied. “The Vice-Warden might
hear you. He’s getting awfully strict!”</p>
<p>This reminded the poor children of all the
troubles, about which they had come to their
old friend. Bruno sat down on the floor
and began crying. “He <i>is</i> so cruel!” he
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
sobbed. “And he lets Uggug take away <i>all</i>
my toys! And such horrid meals!”</p>
<p>“What did you have for dinner to-day?” said
the Professor.</p>
<p>“A little piece of a dead crow,” was Bruno’s
mournful reply.</p>
<p>“He means rook-pie,” Sylvie explained.</p>
<p>“It <i>were</i> a dead crow,” Bruno persisted.
“And there were a apple-pudding—and Uggug
ate it all—and I got nuffin but a crust!
And I asked for a orange—and—didn’t
get it!” And the poor little fellow buried his
face in Sylvie’s lap, who kept gently stroking
his hair, as she went on. “It’s all true,
Professor dear! They <i>do</i> treat my darling
Bruno very badly! And they’re not kind to
<i>me</i> either,” she added in a lower tone, as if
<i>that</i> were a thing of much less importance.</p>
<p>The Professor got out a large red silk handkerchief,
and wiped his eyes. “I wish I could
help you, dear children!” he said. “But what
<i>can</i> I do?”</p>
<p>“We know the way to Fairyland—where
Father’s gone—quite well,” said Sylvie: “if
only the Gardener would let us out.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_163">163</div>
<p>“Won’t he open the door for you?” said
the Professor.</p>
<p>“Not for <i>us</i>,” said Sylvie: “but I’m sure he
would for <i>you</i>. Do come and ask him, Professor
dear!”</p>
<p>“I’ll come this minute!” said the Professor.</p>
<p>Bruno sat up and dried his eyes. “<i>Isn’t</i>
he kind, Mister Sir?”</p>
<p>“He is <i>indeed</i>,” said I. But the Professor
took no notice of my remark. He had put on
a beautiful cap with a long tassel, and was
selecting one of the Other Professor’s walking-sticks,
from a stand in the corner of the room.
“A thick stick in one’s hand makes people respectful,”
he was saying to himself. “Come
along, dear children!” And we all went out
into the garden together.</p>
<p>“I shall address him, first of all,” the
Professor explained as we went along, “with a
few playful remarks on the weather. I shall
then question him about the Other Professor.
This will have a double advantage. First, it
will open the conversation (you can’t even
drink a bottle of wine without opening it first):
and secondly, if he’s seen the Other Professor,
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
we shall find him that way: and, if he hasn’t,
we sha’n’t.”</p>
<p>On our way, we passed the target, at which
Uggug had been made to shoot during the
Ambassador’s visit.</p>
<p>“See!” said the Professor, pointing out a
hole in the middle of the bull’s-eye. “His
Imperial Fatness had only <i>one</i> shot at it; and
he went in just <i>here</i>!”</p>
<p>Bruno carefully examined the hole. “Couldn’t
go in <i>there</i>,” he whispered to me. “He are
too <i>fat</i>!”</p>
<p>We had no sort of difficulty in <i>finding</i> the
Gardener. Though he was hidden from us by
some trees, that harsh voice of his served to
direct us; and, as we drew nearer, the words
of his song became more and more plainly
audible:—</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He thought he saw an Albatross</p>
<p class="t">That fluttered round the lamp:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Penny-Postage-Stamp.</p>
<p class="t0">‘You’d best be getting home,’ he said:</p>
<p class="t">‘The nights are very damp!’”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_165">165</div>
<div class="img" id="fig25">
<img src="images/i165.jpg" alt="‘HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ALBATROSS’" width="500" height="394" />
<p class="center small">‘HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ALBATROSS’</p>
</div>
<p>“Would it be afraid of catching cold?” said
Bruno.</p>
<p>“If it got <i>very</i> damp,” Sylvie suggested, “it
might stick to something, you know.”</p>
<p>“And <i>that</i> somefin would have to go by
the post, whatever it was!” Bruno eagerly exclaimed.
“Suppose it was a cow! Wouldn’t
it be <i>dreadful</i> for the other things!”</p>
<p>“And all these things happened to <i>him</i>,”
said the Professor. “That’s what makes the
song so interesting.”</p>
<p>“He must have had a very curious life,”
said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“You may say that!” the Professor heartily
rejoined.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<p>“Of course she may!” cried Bruno.</p>
<p>By this time we had come up to the
Gardener, who was standing on one leg, as
usual, and busily employed in watering a bed
of flowers with an empty watering-can.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t got no water in it!” Bruno
explained to him, pulling his sleeve to attract
his attention.</p>
<p>“It’s lighter to hold,” said the Gardener. “A
lot of water in it makes one’s arms ache.”
And he went on with his work, singing softly
to himself</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“The nights are very damp!”</p>
</div>
<p>“In digging things out of the ground—which
you probably do now and then,” the
Professor began in a loud voice; “in making
things into heaps—which no doubt you often
do; and in kicking things about with one
heel—which you seem never to leave off doing;
have you ever happened to notice another Professor,
something like me, but different?”</p>
<p>“Never!” shouted the Gardener, so loudly
and violently that we all drew back in alarm.</p>
<p>“There ain’t such a thing!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_167">167</div>
<p>“We will try a less exciting topic,” the
Professor mildly remarked to the children.
“You were asking——”</p>
<p>“We asked him to let us through the garden-door,”
said Sylvie: “but he wouldn’t: but
perhaps he would for <i>you</i>!”</p>
<p>The Professor put the request, very humbly
and courteously.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t mind letting <i>you</i> out,” said the
Gardener. “But I mustn’t open the door for
<i>children</i>. D’you think I’d disobey the <i>Rules</i>?
Not for one-and-sixpence!”</p>
<p>The Professor cautiously produced a couple
of shillings.</p>
<p>“That’ll do it!” the Gardener shouted, as
he hurled the watering-can across the flower-bed,
and produced a handful of keys—one
large one, and a number of small ones.</p>
<p>“But look here, Professor dear!” whispered
Sylvie. “He needn’t open the door for <i>us</i>,
at all. We can go out with <i>you</i>.”</p>
<p>“True, dear child!” the Professor thankfully
replied, as he replaced the coins in his pocket.
“That saves two shillings!” And he took the
children’s hands, that they might all go out
<span class="pb" id="Page_168">168</span>
together when the door was opened. This,
however, did not seem a very likely event,
though the Gardener patiently tried all the
small keys, over and over again.</p>
<p>At last the Professor ventured on a gentle
suggestion. “Why not try the <i>large</i> one? I
have often observed that a door unlocks <i>much</i>
more nicely with its <i>own</i> key.”</p>
<p>The very first trial of the large key proved
a success: the Gardener opened the door, and
held out his hand for the money.</p>
<p>The Professor shook his head. “You are
acting by <i>Rule</i>,” he explained, “in opening
the door for <i>me</i>. And now it’s open, we are
going out by <i>Rule</i>—the Rule of <i>Three</i>.”</p>
<p>The Gardener looked puzzled, and let us go
out; but, as he locked the door behind us, we
heard him singing thoughtfully to himself</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He thought he saw a Garden-Door</p>
<p class="t">That opened with a key:</p>
<p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
<p class="t">A Double Rule of Three:</p>
<p class="t0">‘And all its mystery,’ he said,</p>
<p class="t">‘Is clear as day to me!’”</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>“I shall now return,” said the Professor,
when we had walked a few yards: “you see,
it’s impossible to read <i>here</i>, for all my books
are in the house.”</p>
<p>But the children still kept fast hold of his
hands. “<i>Do</i> come with us!” Sylvie entreated
with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, well!” said the good-natured old
man. “Perhaps I’ll come after you, some day
soon. But I <i>must</i> go back <i>now</i>. You see I
left off at a comma, and it’s so awkward not
knowing how the sentence finishes! Besides,
you’ve got to go through Dogland first, and
I’m always a little nervous about dogs. But
it’ll be quite easy to come, as soon as I’ve
completed my new invention—for carrying
one’s-<i>self</i>, you know. It wants just a <i>little</i>
more working-out.”</p>
<p>“Won’t that be very tiring, to carry <i>yourself</i>?”
Sylvie enquired.</p>
<p>“Well, no, my child. You see, whatever
fatigue one incurs by <i>carrying</i>, one saves by
<i>being carried</i>! Good-bye, dears! Good-bye,
Sir!” he added to my intense surprise, giving
my hand an affectionate squeeze.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
<p>“Good-bye, Professor!” I replied: but my
voice sounded strange and far away, and the
children took not the slightest notice of our
farewell. Evidently they neither saw me nor
heard me, as, with their arms lovingly twined
round each other, they marched boldly on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<h2 id="c13">CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><span class="small">A VISIT TO DOGLAND.</span></h2>
<p>“There’s a house, away there to the left,”
said Sylvie, after we had walked what seemed
to me about fifty miles. “Let’s go and ask for
a night’s lodging.”</p>
<p>“It looks a very comfable house,” Bruno
said, as we turned into the road leading up to
it. “I doos hope the Dogs will be kind to us,
I <i>is</i> so tired and hungry!”</p>
<p>A Mastiff, dressed in a scarlet collar, and
carrying a musket, was pacing up and down,
like a sentinel, in front of the entrance. He
started, on catching sight of the children, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
came forwards to meet them, keeping his
musket pointed straight at Bruno, who stood
quite still, though he turned pale and kept tight
hold of Sylvie’s hand, while the Sentinel walked
solemnly round and round them, and looked at
them from all points of view.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig26">
<img src="images/i172.jpg" alt="THE MASTIFF-SENTINEL" width="500" height="388" />
<p class="center small">THE MASTIFF-SENTINEL</p>
</div>
<p>“Oobooh, hooh boohooyah!” He growled
at last. “Woobah yahwah oobooh! Bow
wahbah woobooyah? Bow wow?” he asked
Bruno, severely.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
<p>Of course <i>Bruno</i> understood all this, easily
enough. All Fairies understand Doggee—that
is, Dog-language. But, as <i>you</i> may find it
a little difficult, just at first, I had better put it
into English for you. “Humans, I verily believe!
A couple of stray Humans! What Dog
do you belong to? What do you want?”</p>
<p>“We don’t belong to a <i>Dog</i>!” Bruno began,
in Doggee. (“Peoples <i>never</i> belongs to Dogs!”
he whispered to Sylvie.)</p>
<p>But Sylvie hastily checked him, for fear of
hurting the Mastiff’s feelings. “Please, we
want a little food, and a night’s lodging—if
there’s room in the house,” she added timidly.
Sylvie spoke Doggee very prettily: but I think
it’s almost better, for <i>you</i>, to give the conversation
in English.</p>
<p>“The <i>house</i>, indeed!” growled the Sentinel.
“Have you never seen a <i>Palace</i> in your life?
Come along with me! His Majesty must settle
what’s to be done with you.”</p>
<p>They followed him through the entrance-hall,
down a long passage, and into a magnificent
Saloon, around which were grouped dogs of all
sorts and sizes. Two splendid Blood-hounds
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
were solemnly sitting up, one on each side of
the crown-bearer. Two or three Bull-dogs—whom
I guessed to be the Body-Guard of the
King—were waiting in grim silence: in fact
the only voices at all plainly audible were
those of two little dogs, who had mounted a
settee, and were holding a lively discussion
that looked very like a quarrel.</p>
<p>“Lords and Ladies in Waiting, and various
Court Officials,” our guide gruffly remarked,
as he led us in. Of <i>me</i> the Courtiers took no
notice whatever: but Sylvie and Bruno were
the subject of many inquisitive looks, and many
whispered remarks, of which I only distinctly
caught <i>one</i>—made by a sly-looking Dachshund
to his friend—“Bah wooh wahyah hoobah
Oobooh, <i>hah</i> bah?” (“She’s not such a bad-looking
Human, <i>is</i> she?”)</p>
<p>Leaving the new arrivals in the centre of
the Saloon, the Sentinel advanced to a door,
at the further end of it, which bore an inscription,
painted on it in Doggee, “Royal
Kennel—Scratch and Yell.”</p>
<p>Before doing this, the Sentinel turned to the
children, and said “Give me your names.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<p>“We’d rather not!” Bruno exclaimed, pulling
Sylvie away from the door. “We want them
ourselves. Come back, Sylvie! Come quick!”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” said Sylvie very decidedly:
and gave their names in Doggee.</p>
<p>Then the Sentinel scratched violently at the
door, and gave a yell that made Bruno shiver
from head to foot.</p>
<p>“Hooyah wah!” said a deep voice inside.
(That’s Doggee for “Come in!”)</p>
<p>“It’s the King himself!” the Mastiff whispered
in an awestruck tone. “Take off your wigs,
and lay them humbly at his paws.” (What <i>we</i>
should call “at his <i>feet</i>.”)</p>
<p>Sylvie was just going to explain, very
politely, that really they <i>couldn’t</i> perform <i>that</i>
ceremony, because their wigs wouldn’t come
off, when the door of the Royal Kennel opened,
and an enormous Newfoundland Dog put his
head out. “Bow wow?” was his first question.</p>
<p>“When His Majesty speaks to you,” the
Sentinel hastily whispered to Bruno, “you
should prick up your ears!”</p>
<p>Bruno looked doubtfully at Sylvie. “I’d
rather not, please,” he said. “It would hurt.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<div class="img" id="fig27">
<img src="images/i176.jpg" alt="THE DOG-KING" width="500" height="323" />
<p class="center small">THE DOG-KING</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>“It doesn’t hurt a bit!” the Sentinel said
with some indignation. “Look! It’s like this!”
And he pricked up his ears like two railway
signals.</p>
<p>Sylvie gently explained matters. “I’m afraid
we ca’n’t manage it,” she said in a low voice.
“I’m very sorry: but our ears haven’t got the
right—” she wanted to say “machinery” in
Doggee: but she had forgotten the word, and
could only think of “steam-engine.”</p>
<p>The Sentinel repeated Sylvie’s explanation
to the King.</p>
<p>“Can’t prick up their ears without a steam-engine!”
His Majesty exclaimed. “They <i>must</i>
be curious creatures! I must have a look at
them!” And he came out of his Kennel, and
walked solemnly up to the children.</p>
<p>What was the amazement—not to say the
horror—of the whole assembly, when Sylvie
actually <i>patted His Majesty on the head</i>, while
Bruno seized his long ears and pretended to tie
them together under his chin!</p>
<p>The Sentinel groaned aloud: a beautiful
Greyhound—who appeared to be one of the
Ladies in Waiting—fainted away: and all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
other Courtiers hastily drew back, and left
plenty of room for the huge Newfoundland to
spring upon the audacious strangers, and tear
them limb from limb.</p>
<p>Only—he didn’t. On the contrary his
Majesty actually <i>smiled</i>—so far as a Dog <i>can</i>
smile—and (the other Dogs couldn’t believe
their eyes, but it was true, all the same) his
Majesty <i>wagged his tail</i>!</p>
<p>“Yah! Hooh hahwooh!” (that is “Well!
I never!”) was the universal cry.</p>
<p>His Majesty looked round him severely, and
gave a slight growl, which produced instant
silence. “Conduct <i>my friends</i> to the banqueting-hall!”
he said, laying such an emphasis on
“<i>my friends</i>” that several of the dogs rolled
over helplessly on their backs and began to
lick Bruno’s feet.</p>
<p>A procession was formed, but I only ventured
to follow as far as the <i>door</i> of the banqueting-hall,
so furious was the uproar of barking
dogs within. So I sat down by the King,
who seemed to have gone to sleep, and waited
till the children returned to say good-night,
when His Majesty got up and shook himself.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>“Time for bed!” he said with a sleepy
yawn. “The attendants will show you your
room,” he added, aside, to Sylvie and Bruno.
“Bring lights!” And, with a dignified air, he
held out his paw for them to kiss.</p>
<p>But the children were evidently not well
practised in Court-manners. Sylvie simply
stroked the great paw: Bruno hugged it: the
Master of the Ceremonies looked shocked.</p>
<p>All this time Dog-waiters, in splendid livery,
were running up with lighted candles: but, as
fast as they put them upon the table, other
waiters ran away with them, so that there
never seemed to be one for <i>me</i>, though the
Master kept nudging me with his elbow, and
repeating “I ca’n’t let you sleep <i>here</i>! You’re
not in <i>bed</i>, you know!”</p>
<p>I made a great effort, and just succeeded
in getting out the words “I know I’m not.
I’m in an arm-chair.”</p>
<p>“Well, forty winks will do you no harm,” the
Master said, and left me. I could scarcely hear
his words: and no wonder: he was leaning
over the side of a ship, that was miles away
from the pier on which I stood. The ship
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
passed over the horizon, and I sank back into
the arm-chair.</p>
<p>The next thing I remember is that it was
morning: breakfast was just over: Sylvie was
lifting Bruno down from a high chair, and saying
to a Spaniel, who was regarding them with
a most benevolent smile, “Yes, thank you, we’ve
had a <i>very</i> nice breakfast. Haven’t we, Bruno?”</p>
<p>“There was too many bones in the——”
Bruno began, but Sylvie frowned at him, and
laid her finger on her lips, for, at this moment,
the travelers were waited on by a very dignified
officer, the Head-Growler, whose duty it
was, first to conduct them to the King to bid
him farewell, and then to escort them to the
boundary of Dogland. The great Newfoundland
received them most affably, but, instead
of saying “good-bye,” he startled the Head-Growler
into giving three savage growls, by
announcing that he would escort them himself.</p>
<p>“It is a most unusual proceeding, your
Majesty!” the Head-Growler exclaimed, almost
choking with vexation at being set aside, for he
had put on his best Court-suit, made entirely of
cat-skins, for the occasion.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<p>“I shall escort them myself,” his Majesty
repeated, gently but firmly, laying aside the
Royal robes, and changing his crown for a
small coronet, “and you may stay at home.”</p>
<p>“I <i>are</i> glad!” Bruno whispered to Sylvie,
when they had got well out of hearing. “He
were so <i>welly</i> cross!” And he not only patted
their Royal escort, but even hugged him round
the neck in the exuberance of his delight.</p>
<p>His Majesty calmly wagged the Royal tail.
“It’s quite a relief,” he said, “getting away
from that Palace now and then! Royal Dogs
have a dull life of it, I can tell you! Would
you mind” (this to Sylvie, in a low voice, and
looking a little shy and embarrassed) “would
you mind the trouble of just throwing that
stick for me to fetch?”</p>
<p>Sylvie was too much astonished to do anything
for a moment: it sounded such a monstrous
impossibility that a <i>King</i> should wish to
run after a stick. But <i>Bruno</i> was equal to the
occasion, and with a glad shout of “Hi then!
Fetch it, good Doggie!” he hurled it over a
clump of bushes. The next moment the
Monarch of Dogland had bounded over the
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
bushes, and picked up the stick, and came
galloping back to the children with it in his
mouth. Bruno took it from him with great
decision. “Beg for it!” he insisted; and His
Majesty begged. “Paw!” commanded Sylvie;
and His Majesty gave his paw. In short, the
solemn ceremony of escorting the travelers to
the boundaries of Dogland became one long
uproarious game of play!</p>
<p>“But business is business!” the Dog-King
said at last. “And I must go back to mine.
I couldn’t come any further,” he added, consulting
a dog-watch, which hung on a chain
round his neck, “not even if there were a <i>Cat</i>
in sight!”</p>
<p>They took an affectionate farewell of His
Majesty, and trudged on.</p>
<p>“That <i>were</i> a dear dog!” Bruno exclaimed.
“Has we to go far, Sylvie? I’s tired!”</p>
<p>“Not much further, darling!” Sylvie gently
replied. “Do you see that shining, just beyond
those trees? I’m almost <i>sure</i> it’s the gate of
Fairyland! I know it’s all golden—Father
told me so—and so bright, so bright!” she
went on dreamily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
<p>“It dazzles!” said Bruno, shading his eyes
with one little hand, while the other clung
tightly to Sylvie’s hand, as if he were half-alarmed
at her strange manner.</p>
<p>For the child moved on as if walking in her
sleep, her large eyes gazing into the far distance,
and her breath coming and going in
quick pantings of eager delight. I knew, by
some mysterious mental light, that a great
change was taking place in my sweet little
friend (for such I loved to think her) and that
she was passing from the condition of a mere
Outland Sprite into the true Fairy-nature.</p>
<p>Upon Bruno the change came later: but it
was completed in both before they reached the
golden gate, through which I knew it would
be impossible for <i>me</i> to follow. I could but
stand outside, and take a last look at the two
sweet children, ere they disappeared within,
and the golden gate closed with a bang.</p>
<p>And with <i>such</i> a bang! “It never <i>will</i>
shut like any other cupboard-door,” Arthur
explained. “There’s something wrong with
the hinge. However, here’s the cake and wine.
And you’ve had your forty winks. So you
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
really <i>must</i> get off to bed, old man! You’re
fit for nothing else. Witness my hand, Arthur
Forester, M.D.”</p>
<p>By this time I was wide-awake again. “Not
<i>quite</i> yet!” I pleaded. “Really I’m not sleepy
now. And it isn’t midnight yet.”</p>
<p>“Well, I did want to say another word to
you,” Arthur replied in a relenting tone, as he
supplied me with the supper he had prescribed.
“Only I thought you were too sleepy for it
to-night.”</p>
<p>We took our midnight meal almost in silence;
for an unusual nervousness seemed to have
seized on my old friend.</p>
<p>“What kind of a night is it?” he asked,
rising and undrawing the window-curtains, apparently
to change the subject for a minute.
I followed him to the window, and we stood
together, looking out, in silence.</p>
<p>“When I first spoke to you about——”
Arthur began, after a long and embarrassing
silence, “that is, when we first talked about her—for
I think it was <i>you</i> that introduced the
subject—my own position in life forbade me
to do more than worship her from a distance:
<span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
and I was turning over plans for leaving this
place finally, and settling somewhere out of all
chance of meeting her again. That seemed
to be my only chance of usefulness in life.”</p>
<p>“Would that have been wise?” I said. “To
leave yourself no hope at all?”</p>
<p>“There <i>was</i> no hope to leave,” Arthur firmly
replied, though his eyes glittered with tears
as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky,
from which one solitary star, the glorious
‘Vega,’ blazed out in fitful splendour through
the driving clouds. “She was like that star
to me—bright, beautiful, and pure, but out
of reach, out of reach!”</p>
<p>He drew the curtains again, and we returned
to our places by the fireside.</p>
<p>“What I wanted to tell you was this,” he
resumed. “I heard this evening from my
solicitor. I can’t go into the details of the
business, but the upshot is that my worldly
wealth is much more than I thought, and I
am (or shall soon be) in a position to offer
marriage, without imprudence, to any lady, even
if she brought nothing. I doubt if there would
be anything on <i>her</i> side: the Earl is poor, I
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
believe. But I should have enough for both,
even if health failed.”</p>
<p>“I wish you all happiness in your married
life!” I cried. “Shall you speak to the Earl
to-morrow?”</p>
<p>“Not yet awhile,” said Arthur. “He is very
friendly, but I dare not think he means more
than that, as yet. And as for—as for Lady
Muriel, try as I may, I <i>cannot</i> read her feelings
towards me. If there <i>is</i> love, she is hiding it!
No, I must wait, I must wait!”</p>
<p>I did not like to press any further advice on
my friend, whose judgment, I felt, was so much
more sober and thoughtful than my own; and
we parted without more words on the subject
that had now absorbed his thoughts, nay, his
very life.</p>
<p>The next morning a letter from <i>my</i> solicitor
arrived, summoning me to town on important
business.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><span class="small">FAIRY-SYLVIE.</span></h2>
<p>For a full month the business, for which I
had returned to London, detained me there:
and even then it was only the urgent advice
of my physician that induced me to leave it
unfinished and pay another visit to Elveston.</p>
<p>Arthur had written once or twice during
the month; but in none of his letters was
there any mention of Lady Muriel. Still, I
did not augur ill from his silence: to me it
looked like the natural action of a lover, who,
even while his heart was singing “She is
mine!”, would fear to paint his happiness in
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
the cold phrases of a written letter, but would
wait to tell it by word of mouth. “Yes,” I
thought, “I am to hear his song of triumph
from his own lips!”</p>
<p>The night I arrived we had much to say on
other matters: and, tired with the journey, I
went to bed early, leaving the happy secret
still untold. Next day, however, as we chatted
on over the remains of luncheon, I ventured
to put the momentous question. “Well, old
friend, you have told me nothing of Lady
Muriel—nor when the happy day is to be?”</p>
<p>“The happy day,” Arthur said, looking
unexpectedly grave, “is yet in the dim future.
We need to know—or, rather, <i>she</i> needs to
know <i>me</i> better. I know <i>her</i> sweet nature,
thoroughly, by this time. But I dare not speak
till I am sure that my love is returned.”</p>
<p>“Don’t wait too long!” I said gaily. “Faint
heart never won fair lady!”</p>
<p>“It <i>is</i> ‘faint heart,’ perhaps. But really I
<i>dare</i> not speak just yet.”</p>
<p>“But meanwhile,” I pleaded, “you are running
a risk that perhaps you have not thought
of. Some other man——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>“No,” said Arthur firmly. “She is heart-whole:
I am sure of that. Yet, if she loves
another better than me, so be it! I will not
spoil her happiness. The secret shall die with
me. But she is my first—and my <i>only</i> love!”</p>
<p>“That is all very beautiful <i>sentiment</i>,” I said,
“but it is not <i>practical</i>. It is not like <i>you</i>.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He either fears his fate too much,</p>
<p class="t">Or his desert is small,</p>
<p class="t0">Who dares not put it to the touch,</p>
<p class="t">To win or lose it all.”</p>
</div>
<p>“I <i>dare</i> not ask the question whether there
is another!” he said passionately. “It would
break my heart to know it!”</p>
<p>“Yet is it wise to leave it unasked? You
must not waste your life upon an ‘if’!”</p>
<p>“I tell you I <i>dare</i> not!”</p>
<p>“May <i>I</i> find it out for you?” I asked, with
the freedom of an old friend.</p>
<p>“No, no!” he replied with a pained look.
“I entreat you to say nothing. Let it wait.”</p>
<p>“As you please,” I said: and judged it best
to say no more just then. “But this evening,”
I thought, “I will call on the Earl. I may be
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
able to <i>see</i> how the land lies, without so much
as saying a word!”</p>
<p>It was a very hot afternoon—too hot to go
for a walk or do anything—or else it wouldn’t
have happened, I believe.</p>
<p>In the first place, I want to know—dear
Child who reads this!—why Fairies should
always be teaching <i>us</i> to do our duty, and
lecturing <i>us</i> when we go wrong, and we should
never teach <i>them</i> anything? You can’t mean
to say that Fairies are never greedy, or selfish,
or cross, or deceitful, because that would be
nonsense, you know. Well then, don’t you
think they might be all the better for a little
lecturing and punishing now and then?</p>
<p>I really don’t see why it shouldn’t be tried,
and I’m almost sure that, if you could only
catch a Fairy, and put it in the corner, and
give it nothing but bread and water for a day
or two, you’d find it quite an improved character—it
would take down its conceit a
little, at all events.</p>
<p>The next question is, what is the best time
for seeing Fairies? I believe I can tell you
all about that.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<p>The first rule is, that it must be a <i>very</i> hot
day—that we may consider as settled: and
you must be just a <i>little</i> sleepy—but not too
sleepy to keep your eyes open, mind. Well,
and you ought to feel a little—what one may
call “fairyish”—the Scotch call it “eerie,”
and perhaps that’s a prettier word; if you
don’t know what it means, I’m afraid I can
hardly explain it; you must wait till you meet
a Fairy, and then you’ll know.</p>
<p>And the last rule is, that the crickets should
not be chirping. I can’t stop to explain that:
you must take it on trust for the present.</p>
<p>So, if all these things happen together, you
have a good chance of seeing a Fairy—or at
least a much better chance than if they didn’t.</p>
<p>The first thing I noticed, as I went lazily
along through an open place in the wood, was
a large Beetle lying struggling on its back, and
I went down upon one knee to help the poor
thing to its feet again. In some things, you
know, you can’t be quite sure what an insect
would like: for instance, I never could quite
settle, supposing I were a moth, whether I
would rather be kept out of the candle, or be
<span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
allowed to fly straight in and get burnt—or
again, supposing I were a spider, I’m not sure
if I should be <i>quite</i> pleased to have my web
torn down, and the fly let loose—but I feel
quite certain that, if I were a beetle and had
rolled over on my back, I should always be
glad to be helped up again.</p>
<p>So, as I was saying, I had gone down upon
one knee, and was just reaching out a little
stick to turn the Beetle over, when I saw a
sight that made me draw back hastily and
hold my breath, for fear of making any noise
and frightening the little creature away.</p>
<p>Not that she looked as if she would be
easily frightened: she seemed so good and
gentle that I’m sure she would never expect
that any one could wish to hurt her. She
was only a few inches high, and was dressed
in green, so that you really would hardly have
noticed her among the long grass; and she
was so delicate and graceful that she quite
seemed to belong to the place, almost as if
she were one of the flowers. I may tell you,
besides, that she had no wings (I don’t believe
in Fairies with wings), and that she had quantities
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
of long brown hair and large earnest
brown eyes, and then I shall have done all
I can to give you an idea of her.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig28">
<img src="images/i193.jpg" alt="FAIRY-SYLVIE" width="500" height="357" />
<p class="center small">FAIRY-SYLVIE</p>
</div>
<p>Sylvie (I found out her name afterwards)
had knelt down, just as I was doing, to help
the Beetle; but it needed more than a little
stick for <i>her</i> to get it on its legs again; it was
as much as she could do, with both arms, to
roll the heavy thing over; and all the while
she was talking to it, half scolding and half
comforting, as a nurse might do with a child
that had fallen down.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>“There, there! You needn’t cry so much
about it. You’re not killed yet—though if
you were, you couldn’t cry, you know, and
so it’s a general rule against crying, my dear!
And how did you come to tumble over?
But I can see well enough how it was—I
needn’t ask you that—walking over sand-pits
with your chin in the air, as usual. Of course
if you go among sand-pits like that, you must
expect to tumble. You should look.”</p>
<p>The Beetle murmured something that sounded
like “I <i>did</i> look,” and Sylvie went on again.</p>
<p>“But I know you didn’t! You never do!
You always walk with your chin up—you’re
so dreadfully conceited. Well, let’s see how
many legs are broken this time. Why, none
of them, I declare! And what’s the good
of having six legs, my dear, if you can only
kick them all about in the air when you
tumble? Legs are meant to walk with, you
know. Now don’t begin putting out your
wings yet; I’ve more to say. Go to the
frog that lives behind that buttercup—give
him my compliments—Sylvie’s compliments—can
you say ‘compliments’?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_195">195</div>
<p>The Beetle tried and, I suppose, succeeded.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. And tell him he’s to give
you some of that salve I left with him yesterday.
And you’d better get him to rub it in
for you. He’s got rather cold hands, but you
mustn’t mind that.”</p>
<p>I think the Beetle must have shuddered at
this idea, for Sylvie went on in a graver tone.
“Now you needn’t pretend to be so particular
as all that, as if you were too grand to be
rubbed by a frog. The fact is, you ought to
be very much obliged to him. Suppose you
could get nobody but a toad to do it, how
would you like <i>that</i>?”</p>
<p>There was a little pause, and then Sylvie
added “Now you may go. Be a good beetle,
and don’t keep your chin in the air.” And then
began one of those performances of humming,
and whizzing, and restless banging about, such
as a beetle indulges in when it has decided on
flying, but hasn’t quite made up its mind which
way to go. At last, in one of its awkward zig-zags,
it managed to fly right into my face, and,
by the time I had recovered from the shock,
the little Fairy was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
<p>I looked about in all directions for the little
creature, but there was no trace of her—and
my ‘eerie’ feeling was quite gone off, and
the crickets were chirping again merrily—so
I knew she was really gone.</p>
<p>And now I’ve got time to tell you the rule
about the crickets. They always leave off chirping
when a Fairy goes by—because a Fairy’s
a kind of queen over them, I suppose—at all
events it’s a much grander thing than a cricket—so
whenever you’re walking out, and the
crickets suddenly leave off chirping, you may
be sure that they see a Fairy.</p>
<p>I walked on sadly enough, you may be sure.
However, I comforted myself with thinking
“It’s been a very wonderful afternoon, so far.
I’ll just go quietly on and look about me, and
I shouldn’t wonder if I were to come across
another Fairy somewhere.”</p>
<p>Peering about in this way, I happened to
notice a plant with rounded leaves, and with
queer little holes cut in the middle of several
of them. “Ah, the leafcutter bee!” I carelessly
remarked—you know I am very learned in
Natural History (for instance, I can always tell
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
kittens from chickens at one glance)—and I
was passing on, when a sudden thought made
me stoop down and examine the leaves.</p>
<p>Then a little thrill of delight ran through me—for
I noticed that the holes were all arranged
so as to form letters; there were three leaves
side by side, with “B,” “R,” and “U” marked
on them, and after some search I found two
more, which contained an “N” and an “O.”</p>
<p>And then, all in a moment, a flash of inner
light seemed to illumine a part of my life that
had all but faded into oblivion—the strange
visions I had experienced during my journey
to Elveston: and with a thrill of delight I
thought “Those visions are destined to be
linked with my waking life!”</p>
<p>By this time the ‘eerie’ feeling had come
back again, and I suddenly observed that no
crickets were chirping; so I felt quite sure
that “Bruno” was somewhere very near.</p>
<p>And so indeed he was—so near that I had
very nearly walked over him without seeing
him; which would have been dreadful, always
supposing that Fairies <i>can</i> be walked over—my
own belief is that they are something of
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
the nature of Will-o’-the-Wisps: and there’s
no walking over <i>them</i>.</p>
<p>Think of any pretty little boy you know,
with rosy cheeks, large dark eyes, and tangled
brown hair, and then fancy him made small
enough to go comfortably into a coffee-cup,
and you’ll have a very fair idea of him.</p>
<p>“What’s your name, little one?” I began,
in as soft a voice as I could manage. And,
by the way, why is it we always begin by
asking little children their names? Is it
because we fancy a name will help to make
them a little bigger? You never thought of
asking a real large man his name, now, did
you? But, however that may be, I felt it
quite necessary to know <i>his</i> name; so, as he
didn’t answer my question, I asked it again
a little louder. “What’s your name, my little
man?”</p>
<p>“What’s oors?” he said, without looking up.</p>
<p>I told him my name quite gently, for he was
much too small to be angry with.</p>
<p>“Duke of Anything?” he asked, just looking
at me for a moment, and then going on with
his work.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
<p>“Not Duke at all,” I said, a little ashamed
of having to confess it.</p>
<p>“Oo’re big enough to be two Dukes,” said
the little creature. “I suppose oo’re Sir Something,
then?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said, feeling more and more ashamed.
“I haven’t got any title.”</p>
<p>The Fairy seemed to think that in that case
I really wasn’t worth the trouble of talking to,
for he quietly went on digging, and tearing the
flowers to pieces.</p>
<p>After a few minutes I tried again. “<i>Please</i>
tell me what your name is.”</p>
<p>“Bruno,” the little fellow answered, very
readily. “Why didn’t oo say ‘please’ before?”</p>
<p>“That’s something like what we used to be
taught in the nursery,” I thought to myself,
looking back through the long years (about
a hundred of them, since you ask the question),
to the time when I was a little child.
And here an idea came into my head, and
I asked him “Aren’t you one of the Fairies
that teach children to be good?”</p>
<p>“Well, we have to do that sometimes,” said
Bruno, “and a dreadful bother it is.” As he
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
said this, he savagely tore a heartsease in two,
and trampled on the pieces.</p>
<p>“What <i>are</i> you doing there, Bruno?” I said.</p>
<p>“Spoiling Sylvie’s garden,” was all the answer
Bruno would give at first. But, as he
went on tearing up the flowers, he muttered to
himself “The nasty cross thing—wouldn’t let
me go and play this morning,—said I must
finish my lessons first—lessons, indeed! I’ll
vex her finely, though!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Bruno, you shouldn’t do that!” I cried.
“Don’t you know that’s revenge? And revenge
is a wicked, cruel, dangerous thing!”</p>
<p>“River-edge?” said Bruno. “What a funny
word! I suppose oo call it cruel and dangerous
’cause, if oo wented too far and tumbleded
in, oo’d get drownded.”</p>
<p>“No, not river-edge,” I explained: “re-venge”
(saying the word very slowly). But I
couldn’t help thinking that Bruno’s explanation
did very well for either word.</p>
<p>“Oh!” said Bruno, opening his eyes very
wide, but without trying to repeat the word.</p>
<p>“Come! Try and pronounce it, Bruno!” I
said, cheerfully. “Re-venge, re-venge.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
<p>But Bruno only tossed his little head, and
said he couldn’t; that his mouth wasn’t the
right shape for words of that kind. And the
more I laughed, the more sulky the little
fellow got about it.</p>
<p>“Well, never mind, my little man!” I said.
“Shall I help you with that job?”</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” Bruno said, quite pacified.
“Only I wiss I could think of somefin to
vex her more than this. Oo don’t know
how hard it is to make her angry!”</p>
<p>“Now listen to me, Bruno, and I’ll teach
you quite a splendid kind of revenge!”</p>
<p>“Somefin that’ll vex her finely?” he asked
with gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>“Something that will vex her finely. First,
we’ll get up all the weeds in her garden. See,
there are a good many at this end—quite
hiding the flowers.”</p>
<p>“But <i>that</i> won’t vex her!” said Bruno.</p>
<p>“After that,” I said, without noticing the remark,
“we’ll water this highest bed—up here.
You see it’s getting quite dry and dusty.”</p>
<p>Bruno looked at me inquisitively, but he said
nothing this time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
<p>“Then after that,” I went on, “the walks
want sweeping a bit; and I think you might
cut down that tall nettle—it’s so close to the
garden that it’s quite in the way——”</p>
<p>“What <i>is</i> oo talking about?” Bruno impatiently
interrupted me. “All that won’t vex
her a bit!”</p>
<p>“Won’t it?” I said, innocently. “Then, after
that, suppose we put in some of these coloured
pebbles—just to mark the divisions between the
different kinds of flowers, you know. That’ll
have a very pretty effect.”</p>
<p>Bruno turned round and had another good
stare at me. At last there came an odd little
twinkle into his eyes, and he said, with quite a
new meaning in his voice, “That’ll do nicely.
Let’s put ’em in rows—all the red together,
and all the blue together.”</p>
<p>“That’ll do capitally,” I said; “and then—what
kind of flowers does Sylvie like best?”</p>
<p>Bruno had to put his thumb in his mouth
and consider a little before he could answer.
“Violets,” he said, at last.</p>
<p>“There’s a beautiful bed of violets down by
the brook——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
<p>“Oh, let’s fetch ’em!” cried Bruno, giving a
little skip into the air. “Here! Catch hold of
my hand, and I’ll help oo along. The grass is
rather thick down that way.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help laughing at his having so
entirely forgotten what a big creature he was
talking to. “No, not yet, Bruno,” I said: “we
must consider what’s the right thing to do first.
You see we’ve got quite a business before us.”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s consider,” said Bruno, putting his
thumb into his mouth again, and sitting down
upon a dead mouse.</p>
<p>“What do you keep that mouse for?” I said.
“You should either bury it, or else throw it
into the brook.”</p>
<p>“Why, it’s to measure with!” cried Bruno.
“How ever would oo do a garden without
one? We make each bed three mouses and a
half long, and two mouses wide.”</p>
<p>I stopped him, as he was dragging it off by
the tail to show me how it was used, for I was
half afraid the ‘eerie’ feeling might go off
before we had finished the garden, and in that
case I should see no more of him or Sylvie.
“I think the best way will be for <i>you</i> to weed
<span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
the beds, while <i>I</i> sort out these pebbles, ready
to mark the walks with.”</p>
<p>“That’s it!” cried Bruno. “And I’ll tell
oo about the caterpillars while we work.”</p>
<p>“Ah, let’s hear about the caterpillars,” I said,
as I drew the pebbles together into a heap and
began dividing them into colours.</p>
<p>And Bruno went on in a low, rapid tone,
more as if he were talking to himself. “Yesterday
I saw two little caterpillars, when I was
sitting by the brook, just where oo go into the
wood. They were quite green, and they had
yellow eyes, and they didn’t see <i>me</i>. And one
of them had got a moth’s wing to carry—a
great brown moth’s wing, oo know, all dry,
with feathers. So he couldn’t want it to eat,
I should think—perhaps he meant to make
a cloak for the winter?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps,” I said, for Bruno had twisted up
the last word into a sort of question, and was
looking at me for an answer.</p>
<p>One word was quite enough for the little
fellow, and he went on merrily.  “Well, and
so he didn’t want the other caterpillar to see
the moth’s wing, oo know—so what must he
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
do but try to carry it with all his left legs,
and he tried to walk on the other set. Of
course he toppled over after that.”</p>
<p>“After what?” I said, catching at the last
word, for, to tell the truth, I hadn’t been
attending much.</p>
<p>“He toppled over,” Bruno repeated, very
gravely, “and if <i>oo</i> ever saw a caterpillar
topple over, oo’d know it’s a welly serious
thing, and not sit grinning like that—and I
sha’n’t tell oo no more!”</p>
<p>“Indeed and indeed, Bruno, I didn’t mean
to grin. See, I’m quite grave again now.”</p>
<p>But Bruno only folded his arms, and said
“Don’t tell <i>me</i>. I see a little twinkle in one
of oor eyes—just like the moon.”</p>
<p>“Why do you think I’m like the moon,
Bruno?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oor face is large and round like the moon,”
Bruno answered, looking at me thoughtfully.
“It doosn’t shine quite so bright—but it’s
more cleaner.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help smiling at this. “You know
I sometimes wash <i>my</i> face, Bruno. The moon
never does that.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<p>“Oh, doosn’t she though!” cried Bruno; and
he leant forwards and added in a solemn
whisper, “The moon’s face gets dirtier and
dirtier every night, till it’s black all across.
And then, when it’s dirty all over—<i>so</i>—” (he
passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks
as he spoke) “then she washes it.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s all clean again, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Not all in a moment,” said Bruno. “What
a deal of teaching oo wants! She washes it
little by little—only she begins at the other
edge, oo know.”</p>
<p>By this time he was sitting quietly on the
dead mouse with his arms folded, and the
weeding wasn’t getting on a bit: so I had
to say “Work first, pleasure afterwards: no
more talking till that bed’s finished.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
<br /><span class="small">BRUNO’S REVENGE.</span></h2>
<p>After that we had a few minutes of silence,
while I sorted out the pebbles, and amused
myself with watching Bruno’s plan of gardening.
It was quite a new plan to me: he
always measured each bed before he weeded
it, as if he was afraid the weeding would
make it shrink; and once, when it came out
longer than he wished, he set to work to
thump the mouse with his little fist, crying
out “There now! It’s all gone wrong again!
Why don’t oo keep oor tail straight when I
tell oo!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do,” Bruno said in a
half-whisper, as we worked. “Oo like Fairies,
don’t oo?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said: “of course I do, or I shouldn’t
have come here. I should have gone to some
place where there are no Fairies.”</p>
<p>Bruno laughed contemptuously. “Why, oo
might as well say oo’d go to some place where
there wasn’t any air—supposing oo didn’t
like air!”</p>
<p>This was a rather difficult idea to grasp. I
tried a change of subject. “You’re nearly the
first Fairy I ever saw. Have <i>you</i> ever seen
any people besides me?”</p>
<p>“Plenty!” said Bruno. “We see ’em when
we walk in the road.”</p>
<p>“But they ca’n’t see <i>you</i>. How is it they
never tread on you?”</p>
<p>“Ca’n’t <i>tread</i> on us,” said Bruno, looking
amused at my ignorance. “Why, suppose
oo’re walking, here—so—” (making little
marks on the ground) “and suppose there’s a
Fairy—that’s me—walking <i>here</i>. Very well
then, oo put one foot here, and one foot here,
so oo doosn’t tread on the Fairy.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>This was all very well as an explanation,
but it didn’t convince me. “Why shouldn’t
I put one foot <i>on</i> the Fairy?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know <i>why</i>,” the little fellow said in
a thoughtful tone. “But I know oo <i>wouldn’t</i>.
Nobody never walked on the top of a Fairy.
Now I’ll tell oo what I’ll do, as oo’re so fond
of Fairies. I’ll get oo an invitation to the
Fairy-King’s dinner-party. I know one of the
head-waiters.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help laughing at this idea. “Do
the waiters invite the guests?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, not <i>to sit down</i>!” Bruno said. “But
to wait at table. Oo’d like that, wouldn’t oo?
To hand about plates, and so on.”</p>
<p>“Well, but that’s not so nice as sitting at
the table, is it?”</p>
<p>“Of course it isn’t,” Bruno said, in a tone
as if he rather pitied my ignorance; “but if
oo’re not even Sir Anything, oo ca’n’t expect
to be allowed to sit at the table, oo know.”</p>
<p>I said, as meekly as I could, that I didn’t expect
it, but it was the only way of going to a
dinner-party that I really enjoyed. And Bruno
tossed his head, and said, in a rather offended
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
tone, that I might do as I pleased—there were
many he knew that would give their ears to go.</p>
<p>“Have you ever been yourself, Bruno?”</p>
<p>“They invited me once, last week,” Bruno
said, very gravely. “It was to wash up the
soup-plates—no, the cheese-plates I mean—that
was grand enough. And I waited at table.
And I didn’t hardly make only <i>one</i> mistake.”</p>
<p>“What was it?” I said. “You needn’t mind
telling <i>me</i>.”</p>
<p>“Only bringing scissors to cut the beef with,”
Bruno said carelessly. “But the grandest thing
of all was, <i>I</i> fetched the King a glass of cider!”</p>
<p>“That <i>was</i> grand!” I said, biting my lip to
keep myself from laughing.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it?” said Bruno, very earnestly.
“Oo know it isn’t every one that’s had such
an honour as <i>that</i>!”</p>
<p>This set me thinking of the various queer
things we call “an honour” in this world, but
which, after all, haven’t a bit more honour in
them than what Bruno enjoyed, when he took
the King a glass of cider.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long I might not have
dreamed on in this way, if Bruno hadn’t suddenly
<span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
roused me. “Oh, come here quick!”
he cried, in a state of the wildest excitement.
“Catch hold of his other horn! I ca’n’t hold
him more than a minute!”</p>
<p>He was struggling desperately with a great
snail, clinging to one of its horns, and nearly
breaking his poor little back in his efforts to
drag it over a blade of grass.</p>
<p>I saw we should have no more gardening if
I let this sort of thing go on, so I quietly took
the snail away, and put it on a bank where he
couldn’t reach it. “We’ll hunt it afterwards,
Bruno,” I said, “if you really want to catch it.
But what’s the use of it when you’ve got it?”</p>
<p>“What’s the use of a fox when oo’ve got
it?” said Bruno. “I know oo big things hunt
foxes.”</p>
<p>I tried to think of some good reason why
“big things” should hunt foxes, and he should
not hunt snails, but none came into my head:
so I said at last, “Well, I suppose one’s as
good as the other. I’ll go snail-hunting myself
some day.”</p>
<p>“I should think oo wouldn’t be so silly,”
said Bruno, “as to go snail-hunting by oorself.
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
Why, oo’d never get the snail along, if
oo hadn’t somebody to hold on to his other
horn!”</p>
<p>“Of course I sha’n’t go <i>alone</i>,” I said, quite
gravely. “By the way, is that the best kind to
hunt, or do you recommend the ones without
shells?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no, we never hunt the ones without
shells,” Bruno said, with a little shudder at the
thought of it. “They’re always so cross about
it; and then, if oo tumbles over them, they’re
ever so sticky!”</p>
<p>By this time we had nearly finished the garden.
I had fetched some violets, and Bruno
was just helping me to put in the last, when he
suddenly stopped and said “I’m tired.”</p>
<p>“Rest then,” I said: “I can go on without
you, quite well.”</p>
<p>Bruno needed no second invitation: he at
once began arranging the dead mouse as a kind
of sofa. “And I’ll sing oo a little song,” he
said, as he rolled it about.</p>
<p>“Do,” said I: “I like songs very much.”</p>
<p>“Which song will oo choose?” Bruno said,
as he dragged the mouse into a place where he
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
could get a good view of me. “‘Ting, ting,
ting’ is the nicest.”</p>
<p>There was no resisting such a strong hint as
this: however, I pretended to think about it for
a moment, and then said “Well, I like ‘Ting,
ting, ting,’ best of all.”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig29">
<img src="images/i213.jpg" alt="BRUNO’S REVENGE" width="500" height="320" />
<p class="center small">BRUNO’S REVENGE</p>
</div>
<p>“That shows oo’re a good judge of music,”
Bruno said, with a pleased look. “How many
hare-bells would oo like?” And he put his
thumb into his mouth to help me to consider.</p>
<p>As there was only one cluster of hare-bells
within easy reach, I said very gravely that I
thought one would do <i>this</i> time, and I picked
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
it and gave it to him. Bruno ran his hand
once or twice up and down the flowers, like
a musician trying an instrument, producing a
most delicious delicate tinkling as he did so.
I had never heard flower-music before—I
don’t think one can, unless one’s in the ‘eerie’
state—and I don’t know quite how to give
you an idea of what it was like, except by
saying that it sounded like a peal of bells a
thousand miles off. When he had satisfied
himself that the flowers were in tune, he
seated himself on the dead mouse (he never
seemed really comfortable anywhere else), and,
looking up at me with a merry twinkle in his
eyes, he began. By the way, the tune was
rather a curious one, and you might like to
try it for yourself, so here are the notes.</p>
<div class="img" id="figm1">

</div>
<p>He sang the first four lines briskly and
merrily, making the hare-bells chime in time
with the music; but the last two he sang
quite slowly and gently, and merely waved
the flowers backwards and forwards. Then
he left off to explain. “The Fairy-King is
Oberon, and he lives across the lake—and
sometimes he comes in a little boat—and we
go and meet him—and then we sing this
song, you know.”</p>
<p>“And then you go and dine with him?” I
said, mischievously.</p>
<p>“Oo shouldn’t talk,” Bruno hastily said: “it
interrupts the song so.”</p>
<p>I said I wouldn’t do it again.</p>
<p>“I never talk myself when I’m singing,”
he went on very gravely: “so <i>oo</i> shouldn’t
either.” Then he tuned the hare-bells once
more, and sang:—</p>

</div>
<p>“Hush, Bruno!” I interrupted in a warning
whisper. “She’s coming!”</p>
<p>Bruno checked his song, and, as she slowly
made her way through the long grass, he
suddenly rushed out headlong at her like a
little bull, shouting “Look the other way!
Look the other way!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
<p>“Which way?” Sylvie asked, in rather a
frightened tone, as she looked round in all
directions to see where the danger could be.</p>
<p>“<i>That</i> way!” said Bruno, carefully turning
her round with her face to the wood. “Now,
walk backwards—walk gently—don’t be
frightened: oo sha’n’t trip!”</p>
<p>But Sylvie <i>did</i> trip notwithstanding: in fact
he led her, in his hurry, across so many little
sticks and stones, that it was really a wonder
the poor child could keep on her feet at all.
But he was far too much excited to think of
what he was doing.</p>
<p>I silently pointed out to Bruno the best place
to lead her to, so as to get a view of the whole
garden at once: it was a little rising ground,
about the height of a potato; and, when they
had mounted it, I drew back into the shade, that
Sylvie mightn’t see me.</p>
<p>I heard Bruno cry out triumphantly “<i>Now</i>
oo may look!” and then followed a clapping
of hands, but it was all done by Bruno himself.
Sylvie was silent—she only stood and
gazed with her hands clasped together, and I
was half afraid she didn’t like it after all.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_218">218</div>
<p>Bruno too was watching her anxiously, and
when she jumped down off the mound, and
began wandering up and down the little walks,
he cautiously followed her about, evidently
anxious that she should form her own opinion
of it all, without any hint from him. And when
at last she drew a long breath, and gave her
verdict—in a hurried whisper, and without
the slightest regard to grammar—“It’s the
loveliest thing as I never saw in all my life
before!” the little fellow looked as well pleased
as if it had been given by all the judges and
juries in England put together.</p>
<p>“And did you really do it all by yourself,
Bruno?” said Sylvie. “And all for me?”</p>
<p>“I was helped a bit,” Bruno began, with a
merry little laugh at her surprise. “We’ve
been at it all the afternoon—I thought oo’d
like—” and here the poor little fellow’s lip
began to quiver, and all in a moment he burst
out crying, and running up to Sylvie he flung
his arms passionately round her neck, and hid
his face on her shoulder.</p>
<p>There was a little quiver in Sylvie’s voice
too, as she whispered “Why, what’s the
<span class="pb" id="Page_219">219</span>
matter, darling?” and tried to lift up his head
and kiss him.</p>
<p>But Bruno only clung to her, sobbing, and
wouldn’t be comforted till he had confessed.
“I tried—to spoil oor garden—first—but
I’ll never—never—” and then came another
burst of tears, which drowned the rest of the
sentence. At last he got out the words “I
liked—putting in the flowers—for <i>oo</i>, Sylvie—and
I never was so happy before.” And
the rosy little face came up at last to be
kissed, all wet with tears as it was.</p>
<p>Sylvie was crying too by this time, and she
said nothing but “Bruno, dear!” and “<i>I</i> never
was so happy before,” though why these two
children who had never been so happy before
should both be crying was a mystery to <i>me</i>.</p>
<p><i>I</i> felt very happy too, but of course I didn’t
cry: “big things” never do, you know—we
leave all that to the Fairies. Only I think it
must have been raining a little just then, for
I found a drop or two on my cheeks.</p>
<p>After that they went through the whole garden
again, flower by flower, as if it were a long
sentence they were spelling out, with kisses for
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
commas, and a great hug by way of a full-stop
when they got to the end.</p>
<p>“Doos oo know, that was my river-edge,
Sylvie?” Bruno solemnly began.</p>
<p>Sylvie laughed merrily. “What <i>do</i> you
mean?” she said. And she pushed back her
heavy brown hair with both hands, and looked
at him with dancing eyes in which the big tear-drops
were still glittering.</p>
<p>Bruno drew in a long breath, and made up
his mouth for a great effort. “I mean re-venge,”
he said: “now oo under’tand.” And
he looked so happy and proud at having said
the word right at last, that I quite envied him.
I rather think Sylvie didn’t “under’tand” at
all; but she gave him a little kiss on each cheek,
which seemed to do just as well.</p>
<p>So they wandered off lovingly together, in
among the buttercups, each with an arm twined
round the other, whispering and laughing as
they went, and never so much as once looked
back at poor me. Yes, once, just before I quite
lost sight of them, Bruno half turned his head,
and nodded me a saucy little good-bye over
one shoulder. And that was all the thanks I
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
got for <i>my</i> trouble. The very last thing I saw
of them was this—Sylvie was stooping down
with her arms round Bruno’s neck, and saying
coaxingly in his ear, “Do you know, Bruno,
I’ve quite forgotten that hard word. Do say
it once more. Come! Only this once, dear!”</p>
<p>But Bruno wouldn’t try it again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
<h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><span class="small">A CHANGED CROCODILE.</span></h2>
<p>The Marvellous—the Mysterious—had
quite passed out of my life for the moment:
and the Common-place reigned supreme. I
turned in the direction of the Earl’s house, as
it was now ‘the witching hour’ of five, and I
knew I should find them ready for a cup of tea
and a quiet chat.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel and her father gave me a delightfully
warm welcome. They were not of
the folk we meet in fashionable drawing-rooms—who
conceal all such feelings as they may
chance to possess beneath the impenetrable
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
mask of a conventional placidity. ‘The Man
with the Iron Mask’ was, no doubt, a rarity
and a marvel in his own age: in modern
London no one would turn his head to give
him a second look! No, these were <i>real</i>
people. When they <i>looked</i> pleased, it meant
that they <i>were</i> pleased: and when Lady Muriel
said, with a bright smile, “I’m <i>very</i> glad to
see you again!”, I knew that it was <i>true</i>.</p>
<p>Still I did not venture to disobey the injunctions—crazy
as I felt them to be—of the love-sick
young Doctor, by so much as alluding to
his existence: and it was only after they had
given me full details of a projected picnic, to
which they invited me, that Lady Muriel exclaimed,
almost as an after-thought, “and <i>do</i>,
if you can, bring Doctor Forester with you!
I’m sure a day in the country would do him
good. I’m afraid he studies too much——”</p>
<p>It was ‘on the tip of my tongue’ to quote
the words “His only books are woman’s
looks!” but I checked myself just in time—with
something of the feeling of one who has
crossed a street, and has been all but run over
by a passing ‘Hansom.’</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
<p>“—and I think he has too lonely a life,”
she went on, with a gentle earnestness that
left no room whatever to suspect a double
meaning. “<i>Do</i> get him to come! And don’t
forget the day, Tuesday week. We can drive
you over. It would be a pity to go by rail—there
is so much pretty scenery on the road.
And our open carriage just holds four.”</p>
<p>“Oh, <i>I’ll</i> persuade him to come!” I said
with confidence—thinking “it would take all
<i>my</i> powers of persuasion to keep him away!”</p>
<p>The picnic was to take place in ten days: and
though Arthur readily accepted the invitation I
brought him, nothing that I could say would
induce him to call—either with me or without
me—on the Earl and his daughter in the
meanwhile. No: he feared to “wear out his
welcome,” he said: they had “seen enough
of him for one while”: and, when at last
the day for the expedition arrived, he was so
childishly nervous and uneasy that I thought
it best so to arrange our plans that we should
go separately to the house—my intention
being to arrive some time after him, so as
to give him time to get over a meeting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_225">225</div>
<p>With this object I purposely made a considerable
circuit on my way to the Hall (as we
called the Earl’s house): “and if I could only
manage to lose my way a bit,” I thought to
myself, “that would suit me capitally!”</p>
<p>In this I succeeded better, and sooner, than
I had ventured to hope for. The path through
the wood had been made familiar to me, by
many a solitary stroll, in my former visit to
Elveston; and how I could have so suddenly
and so entirely lost it—even though I <i>was</i>
so engrossed in thinking of Arthur and his
lady-love that I heeded little else—was a
mystery to me. “And this open place,” I said
to myself, “seems to have some memory about it
I cannot distinctly recall—surely it is the very
spot where I saw those Fairy-Children! But
I hope there are no snakes about!” I mused
aloud, taking my seat on a fallen tree. “I
certainly do <i>not</i> like snakes—and I don’t
suppose <i>Bruno</i> likes them, either!”</p>
<p>“No, he <i>doesn’t</i> like them!” said a demure
little voice at my side. “He’s not <i>afraid</i> of
them, you know. But he doesn’t <i>like</i> them. He
says they’re too waggly!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<p>Words fail me to describe the beauty of the
little group—couched on a patch of moss, on
the trunk of the fallen tree, that met my eager
gaze: Sylvie reclining with her elbow buried in
the moss, and her rosy cheek resting in the
palm of her hand, and Bruno stretched at her
feet with his head in her lap.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig30">
<img src="images/i226.jpg" alt="FAIRIES RESTING" width="500" height="351" />
<p class="center small">FAIRIES RESTING</p>
</div>
<p>“Too waggly?” was all I could say in so
sudden an emergency.</p>
<p>“I’m not praticular,” Bruno said, carelessly:
“but I <i>do</i> like straight animals best——”</p>
<p>“But you like a dog when it wags its tail,”
Sylvie interrupted. “You <i>know</i> you do, Bruno!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
<p>“But there’s more of a dog, isn’t there, Mister
Sir?” Bruno appealed to me. “<i>You</i> wouldn’t
like to have a dog if it hadn’t got nuffin but
a head and a tail?”</p>
<p>I admitted that a dog of that kind would be
uninteresting.</p>
<p>“There <i>isn’t</i> such a dog as that,” Sylvie
thoughtfully remarked.</p>
<p>“But there <i>would</i> be,” cried Bruno, “if the
Professor shortened it up for us!”</p>
<p>“Shortened it up?” I said. “That’s something
new. How does he do it?”</p>
<p>“He’s got a curious machine——” Sylvie was
beginning to explain.</p>
<p>“A <i>welly</i> curious machine,” Bruno broke in,
not at all willing to have the story thus taken
out of his mouth, “and if oo puts in—somefinoruvver—at
<i>one</i> end, oo know—and he
turns the handle—and it comes out at the
uvver end, oh, ever so short!”</p>
<p>“As short as short!” Sylvie echoed.</p>
<p>“And one day—when we was in Outland,
oo know—before we came to Fairyland—me
and Sylvie took him a big Crocodile. And
he shortened it up for us. And it <i>did</i> look so
<span class="pb" id="Page_228">228</span>
funny! And it kept looking round, and saying
‘wherever <i>is</i> the rest of me got to?’ And
then its eyes looked unhappy——”</p>
<p>“Not <i>both</i> its eyes,” Sylvie interrupted.</p>
<p>“Course not!” said the little fellow. “Only
the eye that <i>couldn’t</i> see wherever the rest
of it had got to. But the eye that <i>could</i>
see wherever——”</p>
<p>“How short <i>was</i> the crocodile?” I asked,
as the story was getting a little complicated.</p>
<p>“Half as short again as when we caught it—<i>so</i>
long,” said Bruno, spreading out his arms
to their full stretch.</p>
<p>I tried to calculate what this would come to,
but it was too hard for me. Please make it out
for me, dear Child who reads this!</p>
<p>“But you didn’t leave the poor thing so short
as that, did you?”</p>
<p>“Well, no. Sylvie and me took it back again
and we got it stretched to—to—how much
was it, Sylvie?”</p>
<p>“Two times and a half, and a little bit more,”
said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t like that better than the other
way, I’m afraid?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>“Oh, but it did though!” Bruno put in
eagerly. “It <i>were</i> proud of its new tail! Oo
never saw a Crocodile so proud! Why, it could
go round and walk on the top of its tail, and
along its back, all the way to its head!”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig31">
<img src="images/i229.jpg" alt="A CHANGED CROCODILE" width="500" height="176" />
<p class="center small">A CHANGED CROCODILE</p>
</div>
<p>“Not <i>quite</i> all the way,” said Sylvie. “It
couldn’t, you know.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but it <i>did</i>, once!” Bruno cried triumphantly.
“Oo weren’t looking—but <i>I</i> watched
it. And it walked on tipplety-toe, so as it
wouldn’t wake itself, ’cause it thought it were
asleep. And it got both its paws on its tail.
And it walked and it walked all the way along
its back. And it walked and it walked on its
forehead. And it walked a tiny little way down
its nose! There now!”</p>
<p>This was a good deal worse than the last
puzzle. Please, dear Child, help again!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_230">230</div>
<p>“I don’t believe no Crocodile never walked
along its own forehead!” Sylvie cried, too
much excited by the controversy to limit the
number of her negatives.</p>
<p>“Oo don’t know the <i>reason</i> why it did it!”
Bruno scornfully retorted. “It had a welly
good reason. I <i>heerd</i> it say ‘Why <i>shouldn’t</i> I
walk on my own forehead?’ So a course it
<i>did</i>, oo know!”</p>
<p>“If <i>that’s</i> a good reason, Bruno,” I said,
“why shouldn’t <i>you</i> get up that tree?”</p>
<p>“<i>Shall</i>, in a minute,” said Bruno: “soon as
we’ve done talking. Only two peoples <i>ca’n’t</i>
talk comfably togevver, when one’s getting up
a tree, and the other isn’t!”</p>
<p>It appeared to me that a conversation would
scarcely be ‘comfable’ while trees were being
climbed, even if <i>both</i> the ‘peoples’ were doing
it: but it was evidently dangerous to oppose
any theory of Bruno’s; so I thought it best to
let the question drop, and to ask for an account
of the machine that made things <i>longer</i>.</p>
<p>This time Bruno was at a loss, and left it
to Sylvie. “It’s like a mangle,” she said: “if
things are put in, they get squoze——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
<p>“Squeezeled!” Bruno interrupted.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Sylvie accepted the correction, but
did not attempt to pronounce the word, which
was evidently new to her. “They get—like
that—and they come out, oh, ever so long!”</p>
<p>“Once,” Bruno began again, “Sylvie and
me writed——”</p>
<p>“Wrote!” Sylvie whispered.</p>
<p>“Well, we <i>wroted</i> a Nursery-Song, and the
Professor mangled it longer for us. It were
‘<i>There was a little Man, And he had a little
gun, And the bullets——</i>’”</p>
<p>“I know the rest,” I interrupted. “But would
you say it <i>long</i>—I mean the way that it came
<i>out</i> of the mangle?”</p>
<p>“We’ll get the Professor to <i>sing</i> it for you,”
said Sylvie. “It would spoil it to <i>say</i> it.”</p>
<p>“I would like to meet the Professor,” I said.
“And I would like to take you all with me,
to see some friends of mine, that live near
here. Would you like to come?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think the <i>Professor</i> would like to
come,” said Sylvie. “He’s <i>very</i> shy. But <i>we’d</i>
like it very much. Only we’d better not come
<i>this</i> size, you know.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_232">232</div>
<p>The difficulty had occurred to me already:
and I had felt that perhaps there <i>would</i> be a
slight awkwardness in introducing two such
tiny friends into Society. “What size will
you be?” I enquired.</p>
<p>“We’d better come as—common <i>children</i>,”
Sylvie thoughtfully replied. “That’s the easiest
size to manage.”</p>
<p>“Could you come to-day?” I said, thinking
“then we could have you at the picnic!”</p>
<p>Sylvie considered a little. “Not <i>to-day</i>,”
she replied. “We haven’t got the things ready.
We’ll come on—Tuesday next, if you like.
And now, <i>really</i>, Bruno, you must come and
do your lessons.”</p>
<p>“I <i>wiss</i> oo wouldn’t say ‘<i>really</i> Bruno!’”
the little fellow pleaded, with pouting lips that
made him look prettier than ever. “It <i>always</i>
shows there’s something horrid coming! And
I won’t kiss you, if you’re so unkind.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but you <i>have</i> kissed me!” Sylvie exclaimed
in merry triumph.</p>
<p>“Well then, I’ll <i>un</i>kiss you!” And he threw
his arms round her neck for this novel, but
apparently not <i>very</i> painful, operation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>“It’s <i>very</i> like <i>kissing</i>!” Sylvie remarked,
as soon as her lips were again free for speech.</p>
<p>“Oo don’t know <i>nuffin</i> about it! It were
just the <i>conkery</i>!” Bruno replied with much
severity, as he marched away.</p>
<p>Sylvie turned her laughing face to me.
“Shall we come on Tuesday?” she said.</p>
<p>“Very well,” I said: “let it be Tuesday next.
But where <i>is</i> the Professor? Did he come with
you to Fairyland?”</p>
<p>“No,” said Sylvie. “But he promised he’d
come and see us, <i>some</i> day. He’s getting his
Lecture ready. So he has to stay at home.”</p>
<p>“At home?” I said dreamily, not feeling
quite sure what she had said.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sir. His Lordship and Lady Muriel
<i>are</i> at home. Please to walk this way.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
<h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><span class="small">THE THREE BADGERS.</span></h2>
<p>Still more dreamily I found myself following
this imperious voice into a room where the
Earl, his daughter, and Arthur, were seated.
“So you’re come <i>at last</i>!” said Lady Muriel,
in a tone of playful reproach.</p>
<p>“I was delayed,” I stammered. Though
<i>what</i> it was that had delayed me I should
have been puzzled to explain! Luckily no
questions were asked.</p>
<p>The carriage was ordered round, the hamper,
containing our contribution to the Picnic, was
duly stowed away, and we set forth.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
<p>There was no need for <i>me</i> to maintain the
conversation. Lady Muriel and Arthur were
evidently on those most delightful of terms,
where one has no need to check thought after
thought, as it rises to the lips, with the fear
‘<i>this</i> will not be appreciated—<i>this</i> will give
offence—<i>this</i> will sound too serious—this
will sound flippant’: like very old friends, in
fullest sympathy, their talk rippled on.</p>
<p>“Why shouldn’t we desert the Picnic and
go in some other direction?” she suddenly
suggested. “A party of four is surely self-sufficing?
And as for <i>food</i>, our hamper——”</p>
<p>“Why <i>shouldn’t</i> we? What a genuine
<i>lady’s</i> argument!” laughed Arthur. “A lady
never knows on which side the <i>onus probandi</i>—the
burden of proving—lies!”</p>
<p>“Do <i>men</i> always know?” she asked with a
pretty assumption of meek docility.</p>
<p>“With <i>one</i> exception—the only one I can
think of—Dr. Watts, who has asked the
senseless question</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">‘Why should I deprive my neighbour</p>
<p class="t0">Of his goods against his will?’</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<p>Fancy <i>that</i> as an argument for Honesty! His
position seems to be ‘I’m only honest because
I see no reason to steal.’ And the <i>thief’s</i>
answer is of course complete and crushing.
‘I deprive my neighbour of his goods because
I want them myself. And I do it against his
will because there’s no chance of getting him
to consent to it!’”</p>
<p>“I can give you one other exception,” I
said: “an argument I heard only to-day—and
<i>not</i> by a lady. ‘Why shouldn’t I walk on
my own forehead?’”</p>
<p>“What a curious subject for speculation!”
said Lady Muriel, turning to me, with eyes
brimming over with laughter. “May we know
who propounded the question? And <i>did</i> he
walk on his own forehead?”</p>
<p>“I ca’n’t remember <i>who</i> it was that said it!”
I faltered. “Nor <i>where</i> I heard it!”</p>
<p>“Whoever it was, I hope we shall meet him
at the Picnic!” said Lady Muriel. “It’s a <i>far</i>
more interesting question than ‘<i>Isn’t</i> this a
picturesque ruin?’ ‘<i>Aren’t</i> those autumn-tints
lovely?’ I shall have to answer those two
questions <i>ten</i> times, at least, this afternoon!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<p>“That’s one of the miseries of Society!”
said Arthur. “Why ca’n’t people let one enjoy
the beauties of Nature without having to
<i>say</i> so every minute? Why should Life be
one long Catechism?”</p>
<p>“It’s just as bad at a picture-gallery,” the
Earl remarked. “I went to the R.A. last May,
with a conceited young artist: and he <i>did</i>
torment me! I wouldn’t have minded his
criticizing the pictures <i>himself</i>: but <i>I</i> had to
agree with him—or else to argue the point,
which would have been worse!”</p>
<p>“It was <i>depreciatory</i> criticism, of course?”
said Arthur.</p>
<p>“I don’t see the ‘of course’ at all.”</p>
<p>“Why, did you ever know a conceited man
dare to <i>praise</i> a picture? The one thing he
dreads (next to not being noticed) is <i>to be
proved fallible</i>! If you once <i>praise</i> a picture,
your character for <i>infallibility</i> hangs by a
thread. Suppose it’s a figure-picture, and you
venture to say ‘draws well.’ Somebody measures
it, and finds one of the proportions an
eighth of an inch wrong. <i>You</i> are disposed of
as a critic! ‘Did you say he draws <i>well</i>?’
<span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
your friends enquire sarcastically, while you
hang your head and blush. No. The only
<i>safe</i> course, if any one says ‘draws well,’ is to
shrug your shoulders. ‘<i>Draws</i> well?’ you
repeat thoughtfully. ‘Draws <i>well</i>? Humph!’
That’s the way to become a great critic!”</p>
<p>Thus airily chatting, after a pleasant
drive through a few miles of beautiful
scenery, we reached the <i>rendezvous</i>—a
ruined castle—where the rest of the picnic-party
were already assembled. We spent an
hour or two in sauntering about the ruins:
gathering at last, by common consent, into a
few random groups, seated on the side of a
mound, which commanded a good view of the
old castle and its surroundings.</p>
<p>The momentary silence, that ensued, was
promptly taken possession of—or, more correctly,
taken into custody—by a Voice; a
voice so smooth, so monotonous, so sonorous,
that one felt, with a shudder, that any other
conversation was precluded, and that, unless
some desperate remedy were adopted, we were
fated to listen to a Lecture, of which no man
could foresee the end!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_239">239</div>
<p>The speaker was a broadly-built man, whose
large, flat, pale face was bounded on the North
by a fringe of hair, on the East and West by
a fringe of whisker, and on the South by a
fringe of beard—the whole constituting a
uniform halo of stubbly whitey-brown bristles.
His features were so entirely destitute of
expression that I could not help saying to
myself—helplessly, as if in the clutches of a
night-mare—“they are only penciled in: no
final touches as yet!” And he had a way of
ending every sentence with a sudden smile,
which spread like a ripple over that vast blank
surface, and was gone in a moment, leaving
behind it such absolute solemnity that I felt
impelled to murmur “it was not <i>he</i>: it was
somebody else that smiled!”</p>
<p>“Do you observe?” (such was the phrase
with which the wretch began each sentence)
“Do you observe the way in which that broken
arch, at the very top of the ruin, stands out
against the clear sky? It is placed <i>exactly</i>
right: and there is <i>exactly</i> enough of it. A
little more, or a little less, and all would be
utterly spoiled!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_240">240</div>
<div class="img" id="fig32">
<img src="images/i240.jpg" alt="A LECTURE ON ART" width="500" height="483" />
<p class="center small">A LECTURE ON ART</p>
</div>
<p>“Oh gifted architect!” murmured Arthur,
inaudibly to all but Lady Muriel and myself.
“Foreseeing the exact effect his work would
have, when in ruins, centuries after his
death!”</p>
<p>“And do you observe, where those trees
slope down the hill,” (indicating them with a
sweep of the hand, and with all the patronising
air of the man who has himself arranged the
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
landscape), “how the mists rising from the
river fill up <i>exactly</i> those intervals where we
<i>need</i> indistinctness, for artistic effect? Here,
in the foreground, a few clear touches are
not amiss: but a <i>back</i>-ground without mist,
you know! It is simply barbarous! Yes, we
<i>need</i> indistinctness!”</p>
<p>The orator looked so pointedly at <i>me</i> as
he uttered these words, that I felt bound to
reply, by murmuring something to the effect
that I hardly felt the need <i>myself</i>—and that
I enjoyed looking at a thing, better, when I
could <i>see</i> it.</p>
<p>“Quite so!” the great man sharply took
me up. “From <i>your</i> point of view, that is
correctly put. But for any one who has a
soul for <i>Art</i>, such a view is preposterous.
<i>Nature</i> is one thing. <i>Art</i> is another. <i>Nature</i>
shows us the world as it <i>is</i>. But <i>Art</i>—as
a Latin author tells us—<i>Art</i>, you know—the
words have escaped my memory——”</p>
<p>“<i>Ars est celare Naturam</i>,” Arthur interposed
with a delightful promptitude.</p>
<p>“Quite so!” the orator replied with an
air of relief. “I thank you! <i>Ars est celare
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
Naturam</i>—but that isn’t it.” And, for a
few peaceful moments, the orator brooded,
frowningly, over the quotation. The welcome
opportunity was seized, and <i>another</i> voice
struck into the silence.</p>
<p>“What a <i>lovely</i> old ruin it is!” cried a
young lady in spectacles, the very embodiment
of the March of Mind, looking at Lady Muriel,
as the proper recipient of all really <i>original</i>
remarks. “And <i>don’t</i> you admire those autumn-tints
on the trees? <i>I</i> do, <i>intensely</i>!”</p>
<p>Lady Muriel shot a meaning glance at me;
but replied with admirable gravity. “Oh yes
indeed, indeed! <i>So</i> true!”</p>
<p>“And isn’t it strange,” said the young lady,
passing with startling suddenness from Sentiment
to Science, “that the mere impact of
certain coloured rays upon the Retina should
give us such exquisite pleasure?”</p>
<p>“You have studied Physiology, then?” a
certain young Doctor courteously enquired.</p>
<p>“Oh, <i>yes</i>! Isn’t it a <i>sweet</i> Science?”</p>
<p>Arthur slightly smiled. “It seems a paradox,
does it not,” he went on, “that the image
formed on the Retina should be inverted?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>“It <i>is</i> puzzling,” she candidly admitted.
“Why is it we do not <i>see</i> things upside-down?”</p>
<p>“You have never heard the Theory, then,
that the <i>Brain</i> also is inverted?”</p>
<p>“No <i>indeed</i>! What a <i>beautiful</i> fact! But
how is it <i>proved</i>?”</p>
<p>“<i>Thus</i>,” replied Arthur, with all the gravity
of ten Professors rolled into one. “What we
call the <i>vertex</i> of the Brain is really its <i>base</i>:
and what we call its <i>base</i> is really its <i>vertex</i>:
it is simply a question of <i>nomenclature</i>.”</p>
<p>This last polysyllable settled the matter.
“How truly delightful!” the fair Scientist
exclaimed with enthusiasm. “I shall ask our
Physiological Lecturer why he never gave us
that <i>exquisite</i> Theory!”</p>
<p>“I’d give something to be present when the
question is asked!” Arthur whispered to me,
as, at a signal from Lady Muriel, we moved
on to where the hampers had been collected,
and devoted ourselves to the more <i>substantial</i>
business of the day.</p>
<p>We ‘waited’ on ourselves, as the modern
barbarism (combining two good things in such
a way as to secure the discomforts of both and
<span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
the advantages of neither) of having a picnic
with servants to wait upon you, had not yet
reached this out-of-the-way region—and of
course the gentlemen did not even take their
places until the ladies had been duly provided
with all imaginable creature-comforts. Then
I supplied myself with a plate of something
solid and a glass of something fluid, and found
a place next to Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>It had been left vacant—apparently for
Arthur, as a distinguished stranger: but he
had turned shy, and had placed himself next
to the young lady in spectacles, whose high
rasping voice had already cast loose upon
Society such ominous phrases as “Man is a
bundle of Qualities!”, “the Objective is only
attainable through the Subjective!”. Arthur
was bearing it bravely: but several faces wore
a look of alarm, and I thought it high time
to start some less metaphysical topic.</p>
<p>“In my nursery days,” I began, “when the
weather didn’t suit for an out-of-doors picnic,
we were allowed to have a peculiar kind, that
we enjoyed hugely. The table cloth was laid
<i>under</i> the table, instead of upon it: we sat
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
round it on the floor: and I believe we really
enjoyed that extremely uncomfortable kind of
dinner more than we ever did the orthodox
arrangement!”</p>
<p>“I’ve no doubt of it,” Lady Muriel replied.
“There’s nothing a well-regulated child hates
so much as regularity. I believe a really
healthy boy would thoroughly enjoy Greek
Grammar—if only he might stand on his head
to learn it! And your carpet-dinner certainly
spared you <i>one</i> feature of a picnic, which is to
me its chief drawback.”</p>
<p>“The chance of a shower?” I suggested.</p>
<p>“No, the chance—or rather the certainty—of
<i>live</i> things occurring in combination with
one’s food! <i>Spiders</i> are <i>my</i> bugbear. Now my
father has <i>no</i> sympathy with that sentiment—<i>have</i>
you, dear?” For the Earl had caught the
word and turned to listen.</p>
<p>“To each his sufferings, all are men,” he
replied in the sweet sad tones that seemed
natural to him: “each has his pet aversion.”</p>
<p>“But you’ll never guess <i>his</i>!” Lady Muriel
said, with that delicate silvery laugh that was
music to my ears.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_246">246</div>
<p>I declined to attempt the impossible.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t like <i>snakes</i>!” she said, in a
stage whisper. “Now, isn’t <i>that</i> an unreasonable
aversion? Fancy not liking such a dear,
coaxingly, <i>clingingly</i> affectionate creature as a
snake!”</p>
<p>“Not like <i>snakes</i>!” I exclaimed. “Is such
a thing possible?”</p>
<p>“No, he <i>doesn’t</i> like them,” she repeated
with a pretty mock-gravity. “He’s not <i>afraid</i>
of them, you know. But he doesn’t <i>like</i> them.
He says they’re too waggly!”</p>
<p>I was more startled than I liked to show.
There was something so <i>uncanny</i> in this echo
of the very words I had so lately heard from
that little forest-sprite, that it was only by a
great effort I succeeded in saying, carelessly,
“Let us banish so unpleasant a topic. Won’t
you sing us something, Lady Muriel? I know
you <i>do</i> sing without music.”</p>
<p>“The only songs I know—without music—are
<i>desperately</i> sentimental, I’m afraid! Are
your tears all ready?”</p>
<p>“Quite ready! Quite ready!” came from all
sides, and Lady Muriel—not being one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
those lady-singers who think it <i>de rigueur</i> to
decline to sing till they have been petitioned
three or four times, and have pleaded failure
of memory, loss of voice, and other conclusive
reasons for silence—began at once:—</p>

<p class="t0">Thus, with a grating and uncertain sound,</p>

<p class="t0">“The Mother-Herring, on the salt sea-wave,</p>

<p>Here Bruno broke off suddenly. “The

he said. “And I ca’n’t sing it—not wizout

<p>Instantly Sylvie seated herself upon a tiny
mushroom, that happened to grow in front of a
daisy, as if it were the most ordinary musical
instrument in the world, and played on the
petals as if they were the notes of an organ.
And such delicious <i>tiny</i> music it was! Such
teeny-tiny music!</p>
<p>Bruno held his head on one side, and listened
very gravely for a few moments until he had
caught the melody. Then the sweet childish
voice rang out once more:—</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Oh, dear beyond our dearest dreams,</p>

<p class="t3">A life so free——</p>
<p class="t0">Ipwergis-Pudding to consume,</p>
<p class="t0">And drink the subtle Azzigoom!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“And if, in other days and hours,</p>
<p class="t0">Mid other fluffs and other flowers,</p>
<p class="t0">The choice were given me how to dine——</p>
<p class="t0">‘Name what thou wilt: it shall be thine!’</p>
<p class="t3">Oh, then I see</p>
<p class="t3">The life for me——</p>
<p class="t0">Ipwergis-Pudding to consume,</p>
<p class="t0">And drink the subtle Azzigoom!”</p>
</div>
<p>“Oo may leave off playing <i>now</i>, Sylvie.
I can do the uvver tune much better wizout
a compliment.”</p>
<p>“He means ‘without <i>accompaniment</i>,’” Sylvie
whispered, smiling at my puzzled look: and
she pretended to shut up the stops of the
organ.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“The Badgers did not care to talk to Fish:</p>

<p>I ought to mention that he marked the

<p>“So they all got safe home again,” Bruno
said, after waiting a minute to see if <i>I</i> had

wishing there were some such rule in Society,
at the conclusion of a song—that the singer
<i>herself</i> should say the right thing, and not leave
it to the audience. Suppose a young lady has
just been warbling (‘with a grating and uncertain
sound’) Shelley’s exquisite lyric ‘<i>I arise
from dreams of thee</i>’: how much nicer it would
be, instead of <i>your</i> having to say “Oh, <i>thank</i>
you, <i>thank</i> you!” for the young lady herself
to remark, as she draws on her gloves, while
the impassioned words ‘<i>Oh, press it to thine
own, or it will break at last!</i>’ are still ringing
in your ears, “—but she wouldn’t do it, you
know. So it <i>did</i> break at last.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
<p>“And I <i>knew</i> it would!” she added quietly,
as I started at the sudden crash of broken glass.
“You’ve been holding it sideways for the last
minute, and letting all the champagne run out!
Were you asleep, I wonder? I’m <i>so</i> sorry my
singing has such a narcotic effect!”</p>

<br /><span class="small">QUEER STREET, NUMBER FORTY.</span></h2>
<p>Lady Muriel was the speaker. And, for the
moment, that was the only fact I could clearly
realise. But how she came to be there—and
how <i>I</i> came to be there—and how the glass of
champagne came to be there—all these were
questions which I felt it better to think out in
silence, and not commit myself to any statement
till I understood things a little more clearly.</p>
<p>‘First accumulate a mass of Facts: and <i>then</i>
construct a Theory.’ <i>That</i>, I believe, is the
true Scientific Method. I sat up, rubbed my
eyes, and began to accumulate Facts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>A smooth grassy slope, bounded, at the
upper end, by venerable ruins half buried in
ivy, at the lower, by a stream seen through
arching trees—a dozen gaily-dressed people,
seated in little groups, here and there—some
open hampers—the <i>débris</i> of a picnic—such
were the <i>Facts</i> accumulated by the Scientific
Researcher. And now, what deep, far-reaching
<i>Theory</i> was he to construct from them? The
Researcher found himself at fault. Yet stay!
One Fact had escaped his notice. While all
the rest were grouped in twos and in threes,
<i>Arthur</i> was alone: while all tongues were
talking, <i>his</i> was silent: while all faces were
gay, <i>his</i> was gloomy and despondent. Here
was a <i>Fact</i> indeed! The Researcher felt that
a <i>Theory</i> must be constructed without delay.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel had just risen and left the
party. Could <i>that</i> be the cause of his despondency?
The Theory hardly rose to the
dignity of a Working Hypothesis. Clearly
more Facts were needed.</p>
<p>The Researcher looked round him once
more: and now the Facts accumulated in
such bewildering profusion, that the Theory
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
was lost among them. For Lady Muriel had
gone to meet a strange gentleman, just visible
in the distance: and now she was returning
with him, both of them talking eagerly and
joyfully, like old friends who have been long
parted: and now she was moving from group
to group, introducing the new hero of the
hour: and he, young, tall, and handsome,
moved gracefully at her side, with the erect
bearing and firm tread of a soldier. Verily,
the Theory looked gloomy for Arthur! His
eye caught mine, and he crossed to me.</p>
<p>“He is very handsome,” I said.</p>
<p>“Abominably handsome!” muttered Arthur:
then smiled at his own bitter words. “Lucky
no one heard me but you!”</p>
<p>“Doctor Forester,” said Lady Muriel, who
had just joined us, “let me introduce to you
my cousin Eric Lindon—<i>Captain</i> Lindon, I
should say.”</p>
<p>Arthur shook off his ill-temper instantly and
completely, as he rose and gave the young
soldier his hand. “I have heard of you,” he
said. “I’m very glad to make the acquaintance
of Lady Muriel’s cousin.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
<p>“Yes, that’s all I’m distinguished for, <i>as
yet</i>!” said Eric (so we soon got to call him)
with a winning smile. “And I doubt,”
glancing at Lady Muriel, “if it even amounts
to a good-conduct-badge! But it’s something
to begin with.”</p>
<p>“You must come to my father, Eric,” said
Lady Muriel. “I think he’s wandering among
the ruins.” And the pair moved on.</p>
<p>The gloomy look returned to Arthur’s face:
and I could see it was only to distract his
thoughts that he took his place at the side of
the metaphysical young lady, and resumed
their interrupted discussion.</p>
<p>“Talking of Herbert Spencer,” he began,
“do you really find no <i>logical</i> difficulty in
regarding Nature as a process of involution,
passing from definite coherent homogeneity to
indefinite incoherent heterogeneity?”</p>
<p>Amused as I was at the ingenious jumble
he had made of Spencer’s words, I kept as
grave a face as I could.</p>
<p>“No <i>physical</i> difficulty,” she confidently
replied: “but I haven’t studied <i>Logic</i> much.
Would you <i>state</i> the difficulty?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_259">259</div>
<p>“Well,” said Arthur, “do you accept it as
self-evident? Is it as obvious, for instance,
as that ‘things that are greater than the same
are greater than one another’?”</p>
<p>“To <i>my</i> mind,” she modestly replied, “it
seems <i>quite</i> as obvious. I grasp <i>both</i> truths
by intuition. But <i>other</i> minds may need some
logical—I forget the technical terms.”</p>
<p>“For a <i>complete</i> logical argument,” Arthur
began with admirable solemnity, “we need
two prim Misses——”</p>
<p>“Of course!” she interrupted. “I remember
that word now. And they produce——?”</p>
<p>“A Delusion,” said Arthur.</p>
<p>“Ye—es?” she said dubiously. “I don’t
seem to remember that so well. But what is
the <i>whole</i> argument called?”</p>
<p>“A Sillygism.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes! I remember now. But I don’t
need a Sillygism, you know, to prove that
mathematical axiom you mentioned.”</p>
<p>“Nor to prove that ‘all angles are equal’,
I suppose?”</p>
<p>“Why, of course not! One takes such a
simple truth as that for granted!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>Here I ventured to interpose, and to offer
her a plate of strawberries and cream. I felt
really uneasy at the thought that she <i>might</i>
detect the trick: and I contrived, unperceived
by her, to shake my head reprovingly at the
pseudo-philosopher. Equally unperceived by
her, Arthur slightly raised his shoulders, and
spread his hands abroad, as who should say
“What else can I say to her?” and moved
away, leaving her to discuss her strawberries
by ‘involution,’ or any other way she preferred.</p>
<p>By this time the carriages, that were to
convey the revelers to their respective homes,
had begun to assemble outside the Castle-grounds:
and it became evident—now that
Lady Muriel’s cousin had joined our party—that
the problem, how to convey five people
to Elveston, with a carriage that would only
hold four, must somehow be solved.</p>
<p>The Honorable Eric Lindon, who was at
this moment walking up and down with Lady
Muriel, might have solved it at once, no doubt,
by announcing his intention of returning on
foot. Of <i>this</i> solution there did not seem to
be the very smallest probability.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
<p>The next best solution, it seemed to me, was
that <i>I</i> should walk home: and this I at once
proposed.</p>
<p>“You’re sure you don’t mind?” said the
Earl. “I’m afraid the carriage won’t take us
all, and I don’t like to suggest to Eric to
desert his cousin so soon.”</p>
<p>“So far from minding it,” I said, “I should
prefer it. It will give me time to sketch this
beautiful old ruin.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep you company,” Arthur suddenly
said. And, in answer to what I suppose was a
look of surprise on my face, he said in a low
voice, “I <i>really</i> would rather. I shall be quite
<i>de trop</i> in the carriage!”</p>
<p>“I think I’ll walk too,” said the Earl. “You’ll
have to be content with <i>Eric</i> as your escort,”
he added, to Lady Muriel, who had joined us
while he was speaking.</p>
<p>“You must be as entertaining as Cerberus—‘three
gentlemen rolled into one’—” Lady
Muriel said to her companion. “It will be a
grand military exploit!”</p>
<p>“A sort of Forlorn Hope?” the Captain
modestly suggested.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
<p>“You <i>do</i> pay pretty compliments!” laughed
his fair cousin. “Good day to you, gentlemen
three—or rather deserters three!” And the
two young folk entered the carriage and were
driven away.</p>
<p>“How long will your sketch take?” said
Arthur.</p>
<p>“Well,” I said, “I should like an hour for it.
Don’t you think you had better go without me?
I’ll return by train. I know there’s one in about
an hour’s time.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps that <i>would</i> be best,” said the Earl.
“The Station is quite close.”</p>
<p>So I was left to my own devices, and soon
found a comfortable seat, at the foot of a tree,
from which I had a good view of the ruins.</p>
<p>“It is a very drowsy day,” I said to myself,
idly turning over the leaves of the sketch-book
to find a blank page. “Why, I thought you
were a mile off by this time!” For, to my
surprise, the two walkers were back again.</p>
<p>“I came back to remind you,” Arthur said,
“that the trains go every ten minutes——”</p>
<p>“Nonsense!” I said. “It isn’t the Metropolitan
Railway!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>“It <i>is</i> the Metropolitan Railway,” the Earl
insisted. “This is a part of Kensington.”</p>
<p>“Why do you talk with your eyes shut?”
said Arthur. “Wake up!”</p>
<p>“I think it’s the heat makes me so drowsy,”
I said, hoping, but not feeling quite sure, that
I was talking sense. “Am I awake now?”</p>
<p>“I think <i>not</i>,” the Earl judicially pronounced.
“What do <i>you</i> think, Doctor? He’s only got
one eye open!”</p>
<p>“And he’s snoring like anything!” cried
Bruno. “Do wake up, you dear old thing!”
And he and Sylvie set to work, rolling the
heavy head from side to side, as if its connection
with the shoulders was a matter of
no sort of importance.</p>
<p>And at last the Professor opened his eyes,
and sat up, blinking at us with eyes of utter
bewilderment. “Would you have the kindness
to mention,” he said, addressing me with
his usual old-fashioned courtesy, “whereabouts
we are just now—and <i>who</i> we are, beginning
with me?”</p>
<p>I thought it best to begin with the children.
“This is Sylvie, Sir; and <i>this</i> is Bruno.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
<p>“Ah, yes! I know <i>them</i> well enough!”
the old man murmured. “It’s <i>myself</i> I’m
most anxious about. And perhaps you’ll be
good enough to mention, at the same time,
how I got here?”</p>
<p>“A harder problem occurs to <i>me</i>,” I ventured
to say: “and that is, how you’re to get
back again.”</p>
<p>“True, true!” the Professor replied. “That’s
<i>the</i> Problem, no doubt. Viewed <i>as</i> a Problem,
outside of oneself, it is a <i>most</i> interesting one.
Viewed as a portion of one’s own biography,
it is, I must admit, very distressing!” He
groaned, but instantly added, with a chuckle,
“As to <i>myself</i>, I think you mentioned that I
am——”</p>
<p>“Oo’re the <i>Professor</i>!” Bruno shouted in
his ear. “Didn’t oo know <i>that</i>? Oo’ve
come from <i>Outland</i>! And it’s <i>ever</i> so far
away from here!”</p>
<p>The Professor leapt to his feet with the
agility of a boy. “Then there’s no time to
lose!” he exclaimed anxiously. “I’ll just ask
this guileless peasant, with his brace of buckets
that contain (apparently) water, if he’ll be so
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
kind as to direct us. Guileless peasant!” he
proceeded in a louder voice. “Would you tell
us the way to Outland?”</p>
<p>The guileless peasant turned with a sheepish
grin. “Hey?” was all he said.</p>
<p>“The—way—to—Outland!” the Professor
repeated.</p>
<p>The guileless peasant set down his buckets
and considered. “Ah dunnot——”</p>
<p>“I ought to mention,” the Professor hastily
put in, “that whatever you say will be used in
evidence against you.”</p>
<p>The guileless peasant instantly resumed his
buckets. “Then ah says nowt!” he answered
briskly, and walked away at a great pace.</p>
<p>The children gazed sadly at the rapidly
vanishing figure. “He goes very quick!” the
Professor said with a sigh. “But I <i>know</i> that
was the right thing to say. I’ve studied your
English Laws. However, let’s ask this next
man that’s coming. He is <i>not</i> guileless, and
he is <i>not</i> a peasant—but I don’t know that
either point is of vital importance.”</p>
<p>It was, in fact, the Honourable Eric Lindon,
who had apparently fulfilled his task of escorting
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
Lady Muriel home, and was now strolling
leisurely up and down the road outside the
house, enjoying a solitary cigar.</p>
<p>“Might I trouble you, Sir, to tell us the
nearest way to Outland!” Oddity as he was,
in outward appearance, the Professor was, in
that essential nature which no outward disguise
could conceal, a thorough gentleman.</p>
<p>And, as such, Eric Lindon accepted him instantly.
He took the cigar from his mouth,
and delicately shook off the ash, while he considered.
“The name sounds strange to me,”
he said. “I doubt if I can help you.”</p>
<p>“It is not <i>very</i> far from <i>Fairyland</i>,” the
Professor suggested.</p>
<p>Eric Lindon’s eye-brows were slightly raised
at these words, and an amused smile, which he
courteously tried to repress, flitted across his
handsome face. “A trifle <i>cracked</i>!” he muttered
to himself. “But what a jolly old
patriarch it is!” Then he turned to the
children. “And ca’n’t <i>you</i> help him, little
folk?” he said, with a gentleness of tone
that seemed to win their hearts at once.
“Surely <i>you</i> know all about it?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_267">267</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">‘How many miles to Babylon?</p>
<p class="t">Three-score miles and ten.</p>
<p class="t0">Can I get there by candlelight?</p>
<p class="t">Yes, and back again!’”</p>
</div>
<p>To my surprise, Bruno ran forwards to him,
as if he were some old friend of theirs, seized
the disengaged hand and hung on to it with
both of his own: and there stood this tall
dignified officer in the middle of the road,
gravely swinging a little boy to and fro, while
Sylvie stood ready to push him, exactly as if
a real swing had suddenly been provided for
their pastime.</p>
<p>“We don’t want to get to <i>Babylon</i>, oo know!”
Bruno explained as he swung.</p>
<p>“And it isn’t <i>candlelight</i>: it’s <i>daylight</i>!”
Sylvie added, giving the swing a push of extra
vigour, which nearly took the whole machine
off its balance.</p>
<p>By this time it was clear to me that Eric
Lindon was quite unconscious of my presence.
Even the Professor and the children seemed to
have lost sight of me: and I stood in the midst
of the group, as unconcernedly as a ghost,
seeing but unseen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_268">268</div>
<p>“How perfectly isochronous!” the Professor
exclaimed with enthusiasm. He had his watch
in his hand, and was carefully counting Bruno’s
oscillations. “He measures time quite as accurately
as a pendulum!”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig36">
<img src="images/i268.jpg" alt="‘HOW PERFECTLY ISOCHRONOUS!’" width="500" height="401" />
<p class="center small">‘HOW PERFECTLY ISOCHRONOUS!’</p>
</div>
<p>“Yet even pendulums,” the good-natured
young soldier observed, as he carefully released
his hand from Bruno’s grasp, “are not a joy <i>for
ever</i>! Come, that’s enough for one bout, little
man! Next time we meet, you shall have
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
another. Meanwhile you’d better take this
old gentleman to Queer Street, Number——”</p>
<p>“<i>We’ll</i> find it!” cried Bruno eagerly, as they
dragged the Professor away.</p>
<p>“We are much indebted to you!” the Professor
said, looking over his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Don’t mention it!” replied the officer,
raising his hat as a parting salute.</p>
<p>“<i>What</i> number did you say!” the Professor
called from the distance.</p>
<p>The officer made a trumpet of his two hands.
“Forty!” he shouted in stentorian tones. “And
not <i>piano</i>, by any means!” he added to himself.
“It’s a mad world, my masters, a mad
world!” He lit another cigar, and strolled
on towards his hotel.</p>
<p>“What a lovely evening!” I said, joining
him as he passed me.</p>
<p>“Lovely indeed,” he said. “Where did <i>you</i>
come from? Dropped from the clouds?”</p>
<p>“I’m strolling your way,” I said; and no
further explanation seemed necessary.</p>
<p>“Have a cigar?”</p>
<p>“Thanks: I’m not a smoker.”</p>
<p>“Is there a Lunatic Asylum near here?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_270">270</div>
<p>“Not that I know of.”</p>
<p>“Thought there might be. Met a lunatic
just now. Queer old fish as ever I saw!”</p>
<p>And so, in friendly chat, we took our homeward
ways, and wished each other ‘good-night’
at the door of his hotel.</p>
<p>Left to myself, I felt the ‘eerie’ feeling rush
over me again, and saw, standing at the door
of Number Forty, the three figures I knew
so well.</p>
<p>“Then it’s the wrong house?” Bruno was
saying.</p>
<p>“No, no! It’s the right <i>house</i>,” the Professor
cheerfully replied: “but it’s the wrong
<i>street</i>. <i>That’s</i> where we’ve made our mistake!
Our best plan, now, will be to——”</p>
<p>It was over. The street was empty. Commonplace
life was around me, and the ‘eerie’
feeling had fled.</p>

<h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><span class="small">HOW TO MAKE A PHLIZZ.</span></h2>
<p>The week passed without any further communication
with the ‘Hall,’ as Arthur was
evidently fearful that we might ‘wear out our
welcome’; but when, on Sunday morning, we
were setting out for church, I gladly agreed
to his proposal to go round and enquire after
the Earl, who was said to be unwell.</p>
<p>Eric, who was strolling in the garden, gave
us a good report of the invalid, who was still
in bed, with Lady Muriel in attendance.</p>
<p>“Are you coming with us to church?” I
enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>“Thanks, no,” he courteously replied. “It’s
not—exactly—in my line, you know. It’s an
excellent institution—for the <i>poor</i>. When
I’m with my own folk, I go, just to set them
an example. But I’m not known <i>here</i>: so I
think I’ll excuse myself sitting out a sermon.
Country-preachers are always so dull!”</p>
<p>Arthur was silent till we were out of hearing.
Then he said to himself, almost inaudibly,
“<i>Where two or three are gathered together in
my name, there am I in the midst of them.</i>”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I assented: “no doubt that <i>is</i> the
principle on which church-going rests.”</p>
<p>“And when he <i>does</i> go,” he continued (our
thoughts ran so much together, that our conversation
was often slightly elliptical), “I suppose
he repeats the words ‘<i>I believe in the
Communion of Saints</i>’?”</p>
<p>But by this time we had reached the little
church, into which a goodly stream of worshipers,
consisting mainly of fishermen and
their families, was flowing.</p>
<p>The service would have been pronounced by
any modern æsthetic religionist—or religious
æsthete, which is it?—to be crude and cold:
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
to me, coming fresh from the ever-advancing
developments of a London church under a
<i>soi-disant</i> ‘Catholic’ Rector, it was unspeakably
refreshing.</p>
<p>There was no theatrical procession of demure
little choristers, trying their best not to simper
under the admiring gaze of the congregation:
the people’s share in the service was taken by
the people themselves, unaided, except that a
few good voices, judiciously posted here and
there among them, kept the singing from going
too far astray.</p>
<p>There was no murdering of the noble music,
contained in the Bible and the Liturgy, by its
recital in a dead monotone, with no more expression
than a mechanical talking-doll.</p>
<p>No, the prayers were <i>prayed</i>, the lessons were
<i>read</i>, and—best of all—the sermon was <i>talked</i>;
and I found myself repeating, as we left the
church, the words of Jacob, when he ‘<i>awaked
out of his sleep</i>.’ “‘<i>Surely the Lord is in this
place! This is none other but the house of God,
and this is the gate of heaven.</i>’”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Arthur, apparently in answer to
my thoughts, “those ‘high’ services are fast
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
becoming pure Formalism. More and more the
people are beginning to regard them as ‘performances,’
in which they only ‘assist’ in the
French sense. And it is <i>specially</i> bad for the
little boys. They’d be much less self-conscious
as pantomime-fairies. With all that dressing-up,
and stage-entrances and exits, and being
always <i>en evidence</i>, no wonder if they’re eaten
up with vanity, the blatant little coxcombs!”</p>
<p>When we passed the Hall on our return, we
found the Earl and Lady Muriel sitting out in
the garden. Eric had gone for a stroll.</p>
<p>We joined them, and the conversation soon
turned on the sermon we had just heard, the
subject of which was ‘selfishness.’</p>
<p>“What a change has come over our pulpits,”
Arthur remarked, “since the time when Paley
gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue, ‘<i>the
doing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of
God, and for the sake of everlasting happiness</i>’!”</p>
<p>Lady Muriel looked at him enquiringly, but
she seemed to have learned by intuition, what
years of experience had taught <i>me</i>, that the way
to elicit Arthur’s deepest thoughts was neither
to assent nor dissent, but simply to <i>listen</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_275">275</div>
<p>“At that time,” he went on, “a great tidal
wave of selfishness was sweeping over human
thought. Right and Wrong had somehow been
transformed into Gain and Loss, and Religion
had become a sort of commercial transaction.
We may be thankful that our preachers are
beginning to take a nobler view of life.”</p>
<p>“But is it not taught again and again in the
<i>Bible</i>?” I ventured to ask.</p>
<p>“Not in the Bible as a <i>whole</i>,” said Arthur.
“In the Old Testament, no doubt, rewards and
punishments are constantly appealed to as
motives for action. That teaching is best for
<i>children</i>, and the Israelites seem to have been,
mentally, <i>utter</i> children. We guide our children
thus, at first: but we appeal, as soon as possible,
to their innate sense of Right and Wrong: and,
when <i>that</i> stage is safely past, we appeal to the
highest motive of all, the desire for likeness to,
and union with, the Supreme Good. I think
you will find that to be the teaching of the
Bible, <i>as a whole</i>, beginning with ‘<i>that thy days
may be long in the land</i>,’ and ending with ‘<i>be
ye perfect, even as your Father which is in
heaven is perfect</i>.’”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_276">276</div>
<p>We were silent for awhile, and then Arthur
went off on another tack. “Look at the
literature of Hymns, now. How cankered it
is, through and through, with selfishness!
There are few human compositions more utterly
degraded than some modern Hymns!”</p>
<p>I quoted the stanza</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“Whatever, Lord, we lend to Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Repaid a thousandfold shall be,</p>
<p class="t0">Then gladly will we give to Thee,</p>
<p class="t10">Giver of all!”</p>
</div>
<p>“Yes,” he said grimly: “that is the typical
stanza. And the very last charity-sermon I
heard was infected with it. After giving many
good reasons for charity, the preacher wound
up with ‘and, for all you give, you will be
repaid a thousandfold!’ Oh the utter meanness
of such a motive, to be put before men
who <i>do</i> know what self-sacrifice is, who <i>can</i>
appreciate generosity and heroism! Talk of
Original <i>Sin</i>!” he went on with increasing
bitterness. “Can you have a stronger proof of
the Original Goodness there must be in this
nation, than the fact that Religion has been
<span class="pb" id="Page_277">277</span>
preached to us, as a commercial speculation, for
a century, and that we still believe in a God?”</p>
<p>“It couldn’t have gone on so long,” Lady
Muriel musingly remarked, “if the Opposition
hadn’t been practically silenced—put under
what the French call <i>la clôture</i>. Surely in any
lecture-hall, or in private society, such teaching
would soon have been hooted down?”</p>
<p>“I trust so,” said Arthur: “and, though I
don’t want to see ‘brawling in church’ legalised,
I must say that our preachers enjoy an <i>enormous</i>
privilege—which they ill deserve, and which
they misuse terribly. We put our man into
a pulpit, and we virtually tell him ‘Now, you
may stand there and talk to us for half-an-hour.
We won’t interrupt you by so much as
a <i>word</i>! You shall have it all your own
way!’ And what does he give us in return?
Shallow twaddle, that, if it were addressed to
you over a dinner-table, you would think ‘Does
the man take me for a <i>fool</i>?’”</p>
<p>The return of Eric from his walk checked
the tide of Arthur’s eloquence, and, after a
few minutes’ talk on more conventional topics,
we took our leave. Lady Muriel walked with
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
us to the gate. “You have given me much to
think about,” she said earnestly, as she gave
Arthur her hand. “I’m so glad you came in!”
And her words brought a real glow of pleasure
into that pale worn face of his.</p>
<p>On the Tuesday, as Arthur did not seem
equal to more walking, I took a long stroll
by myself, having stipulated that he was not
to give the <i>whole</i> day to his books, but was to
meet me at the Hall at about tea-time. On
my way back, I passed the Station just as the
afternoon-train came in sight, and sauntered
down the stairs to see it come in. But there
was little to gratify my idle curiosity: and,
when the train was empty, and the platform
clear, I found it was about time to be moving
on, if I meant to reach the Hall by five.</p>
<p>As I approached the end of the platform,
from which a steep irregular wooden staircase
conducted to the upper world, I noticed two
passengers, who had evidently arrived by the
train, but who, oddly enough, had entirely
escaped my notice, though the arrivals had
been so few. They were a young woman and
a little girl: the former, so far as one could
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
judge by appearances, was a nursemaid, or
possibly a nursery-governess, in attendance on
the child, whose refined face, even more than
her dress, distinguished her as of a higher class
than her companion.</p>
<p>The child’s face was refined, but it was also
a worn and sad one, and told a tale (or so I
seemed to read it) of much illness and suffering,
sweetly and patiently borne. She had a
little crutch to help herself along with: and
she was now standing, looking wistfully up
the long staircase, and apparently waiting
till she could muster courage to begin the
toilsome ascent.</p>
<p>There are some things one <i>says</i> in life—as
well as things one <i>does</i>—which come automatically,
by <i>reflex action</i>, as the physiologists
say (meaning, no doubt, action <i>without</i> reflection,
just as <i>lucus</i> is said to be derived ‘<i>a non
lucendo</i>’). Closing one’s eyelids, when something
seems to be flying into the eye, is one of
those actions, and saying “May I carry the
little girl up the stairs?” was another. It
wasn’t that any thought of offering help
occurred to me, and that <i>then</i> I spoke: the
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
first intimation I
had, of being likely
to make that offer,
was the sound of
my own voice, and
the discovery that
the offer had been
made. The servant
paused, doubtfully
glancing from her
charge to me, and
then back again to
the child. “Would
you like it, dear?”
she asked her. But
no such doubt appeared
to cross the child’s mind: she lifted
her arms eagerly to be taken up. “Please!”
was all she said, while a faint smile flickered
on the weary little face. I took her up with
scrupulous care, and her little arm was at once
clasped trustfully round my neck.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig37">

<p class="center small">THE LAME CHILD</p>
</div>
<p>She was a <i>very</i> light weight—so light,
in fact, that the ridiculous idea crossed my
mind that it was rather easier going up, with
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
her in my arms, than it would have been without
her: and, when we reached the road above,
with its cart-ruts and loose stones—all formidable
obstacles for a lame child—I found that I
had said “I’d better carry her over this rough
place,” before I had formed any <i>mental</i> connection
between its roughness and my gentle
little burden. “Indeed it’s troubling you too
much, Sir!” the maid exclaimed. “She can
walk very well on the flat.” But the arm, that
was twined about my neck, clung just an atom
more closely at the suggestion, and decided me
to say “She’s no weight, really. I’ll carry her
a little further. I’m going your way.”</p>
<p>The nurse raised no further objection: and
the next speaker was a ragged little boy, with
bare feet, and a broom over his shoulder, who
ran across the road, and pretended to sweep
the perfectly dry road in front of us. “Give
us a ‘ap’ny!” the little urchin pleaded, with
a broad grin on his dirty face.</p>
<p>“<i>Don’t</i> give him a ‘ap’ny!” said the little
lady in my arms. The <i>words</i> sounded harsh:
but the <i>tone</i> was gentleness itself. “He’s an
<i>idle</i> little boy!” And she laughed a laugh of
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
such silvery sweetness as I had never yet heard
from any lips but Sylvie’s. To my astonishment,
the boy actually <i>joined</i> in the laugh, as
if there were some subtle sympathy between
them, as he ran away down the road and
vanished through a gap in the hedge.</p>
<p>But he was back in a few moments, having
discarded his broom and provided himself,
from some mysterious source, with an exquisite
bouquet of flowers. “Buy a posy, buy a
posy! Only a ‘ap’ny!” he chanted, with the
melancholy drawl of a professional beggar.</p>
<p>“<i>Don’t</i> buy it!” was Her Majesty’s edict,
as she looked down, with a lofty scorn that
seemed curiously mixed with tender interest,
on the ragged creature at her feet.</p>
<p>But this time I turned rebel, and ignored
the royal commands. Such lovely flowers, and
of forms so entirely new to me, were not to
be abandoned at the bidding of any little maid,
however imperious. I bought the bouquet:
and the little boy, after popping the halfpenny
into his mouth, turned head-over-heels, as if
to ascertain whether the human mouth is really
adapted to serve as a money-box.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_283">283</div>
<p>With wonder, that increased every moment,
I turned over the flowers, and examined them
one by one: there was not a single one among
them that I could remember having ever seen
before. At last I turned to the nursemaid.
“Do these flowers grow wild about here? I
never saw——” but the speech died away on
my lips. The nursemaid had vanished!</p>
<p>“You can put me down, <i>now</i>, if you like,”
Sylvie quietly remarked.</p>
<p>I obeyed in silence, and could only ask myself
“Is this a <i>dream</i>?”, on finding Sylvie and
Bruno walking one on either side of me, and
clinging to my hands with the ready confidence
of childhood.</p>
<p>“You’re larger than when I saw you last!”
I began. “Really I think we ought to be
introduced again! There’s so much of you
that I never met before, you know.”</p>
<p>“Very well!” Sylvie merrily replied. “This
is <i>Bruno</i>. It doesn’t take long. He’s only
got one name!”</p>
<p>“There’s <i>another</i> name to me!” Bruno protested,
with a reproachful look at the Mistress
of the Ceremonies. “And it’s—‘<i>Esquire</i>’!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
<p>“Oh, of course. I forgot,” said Sylvie.
“Bruno—<i>Esquire</i>!”</p>
<p>“And did you come here to meet <i>me</i>, my
children?” I enquired.</p>
<p>“You know I <i>said</i> we’d come on Tuesday,”
Sylvie explained. “Are we the proper size
for common children?”</p>
<p>“Quite the right size for <i>children</i>,” I replied,
(adding mentally “though not <i>common</i> children,
by any means!”) “But what became of the
nursemaid?”</p>
<p>“It are <i>gone</i>!” Bruno solemnly replied.</p>
<p>“Then it wasn’t solid, like Sylvie and you?”</p>
<p>“No. Oo couldn’t <i>touch</i> it, oo know. If
oo walked <i>at</i> it, oo’d go right froo!”</p>
<p>“I quite expected you’d find it out, once,”
said Sylvie. “Bruno ran it against a telegraph
post, by accident. And it went in two
halves. But you were looking the other way.”</p>
<p>I felt that I had indeed missed an opportunity:
to witness such an event as a nursemaid
going ‘in two halves’ does not occur twice
in a life-time!</p>
<p>“When did oo guess it were Sylvie?” Bruno
enquired.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_285">285</div>
<div class="img" id="fig38">
<img src="images/i285.jpg" alt="‘IT WENT IN TWO HALVES’" width="500" height="605" />
<p class="center small">‘IT WENT IN TWO HALVES’</p>
</div>
<p>“I didn’t guess it, till it <i>was</i> Sylvie,” I said.
“But how did you manage the nursemaid?”</p>
<p>“<i>Bruno</i> managed it,” said Sylvie. “It’s
called a Phlizz.”</p>
<p>“And how do you make a Phlizz, Bruno?”</p>
<p>“The Professor teached me how,” said Bruno.
“First oo takes a lot of air——”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<p>“Oh, <i>Bruno</i>!” Sylvie interposed. “The Professor
said you weren’t to tell!”</p>
<p>“But who did her <i>voice</i>?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Indeed it’s troubling you too much, Sir!
She can walk very well on the flat.”</p>
<p>Bruno laughed merrily as I turned hastily
from side to side, looking in all directions for
the speaker. “That were <i>me</i>!” he gleefully
proclaimed, in his own voice.</p>
<p>“She can indeed walk very well on the flat,”
I said. “And I think <i>I</i> was the Flat.”</p>
<p>By this time we were near the Hall. “This
is where my friends live,” I said. “Will you
come in and have some tea with them?”</p>
<p>Bruno gave a little jump of joy: and Sylvie
said “Yes, please. You’d like some tea, Bruno,
wouldn’t you? He hasn’t tasted <i>tea</i>,” she explained
to me, “since we left Outland.”</p>
<p>“And <i>that</i> weren’t <i>good</i> tea!” said Bruno.
“It were so <i>welly</i> weak!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_287">287</div>
<h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
<br /><span class="small">LIGHT COME, LIGHT GO.</span></h2>
<p>Lady Muriel’s smile of welcome could not
<i>quite</i> conceal the look of surprise with which
she regarded my new companions.</p>
<p>I presented them in due form. “This is
<i>Sylvie</i>, Lady Muriel. And this is <i>Bruno</i>.”</p>
<p>“Any surname?” she enquired, her eyes
twinkling with fun.</p>
<p>“No,” I said gravely. “No surname.”</p>
<p>She laughed, evidently thinking I said it
in fun; and stooped to kiss the children—a
salute to which <i>Bruno</i> submitted with reluctance:
<i>Sylvie</i> returned it with interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_288">288</div>
<p>While she and Arthur (who had arrived before
me) supplied the children with tea and
cake, I tried to engage the Earl in conversation:
but he was restless and <i>distrait</i>, and we
made little progress. At last, by a sudden
question, he betrayed the cause of his disquiet.</p>
<p>“<i>Would</i> you let me look at those flowers you
have in your hand?”</p>
<p>“Willingly!” I said, handing him the bouquet.
Botany was, I knew, a favourite study of
his: and these flowers were to me so entirely
new and mysterious, that I was really curious
to see what a botanist would say of them.</p>
<p>They did <i>not</i> diminish his disquiet. On the
contrary, he became every moment more excited
as he turned them over. “<i>These</i> are all
from Central India!” he said, laying aside part
of the bouquet. “They are rare, even there:
and I have never seen them in any other part
of the world. <i>These</i> two are Mexican—<i>This</i>
one—” (He rose hastily, and carried it to the
window, to examine it in a better light, the
flush of excitement mounting to his very forehead)
“—is, I am nearly sure—but I have
a book of Indian Botany here—” He took a
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
volume from the book-shelves, and turned the
leaves with trembling fingers. “Yes! Compare
it with this picture! It is the exact
duplicate! This is the flower of the Upas-tree,
which usually grows only in the depths
of forests; and the flower fades so quickly
after being plucked, that it is scarcely possible
to keep its form or colour even so far as the
outskirts of the forest! Yet this is in full
bloom! <i>Where</i> did you get these flowers?”
he added with breathless eagerness.</p>
<p>I glanced at Sylvie, who, gravely and silently,
laid her finger on her lips, then beckoned to
Bruno to follow her, and ran out into the
garden; and I found myself in the position of
a defendant whose two most important witnesses
have been suddenly taken away. “Let
me give you the flowers!” I stammered out
at last, quite ‘at my wit’s end’ as to how to
get out of the difficulty. “You know much
more about them than I do!”</p>
<p>“I accept them most gratefully! But you
have not yet told me—” the Earl was beginning,
when we were interrupted, to my great
relief, by the arrival of Eric Lindon.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
<p>To <i>Arthur</i>, however, the new-comer was, I
saw clearly, anything but welcome. His face
clouded over: he drew a little back from the
circle, and took no further part in the conversation,
which was wholly maintained, for some
minutes, by Lady Muriel and her lively cousin,
who were discussing some new music that had
just arrived from London.</p>
<p>“Do just try this one!” he pleaded. “The
music looks easy to sing at sight, and the
song’s quite appropriate to the occasion.”</p>
<p>“Then I suppose it’s</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">‘Five o’clock tea!</p>
<p class="t0">Ever to thee</p>
<p class="t0">Faithful I’ll be,</p>
<p class="t0">Five o’clock tea!’”</p>
</div>
<p>laughed Lady Muriel, as she sat down to the
piano, and lightly struck a few random chords.</p>
<p>“Not quite: and yet it <i>is</i> a kind of ‘ever
to thee faithful I’ll be!’ It’s a pair of hapless
lovers: <i>he</i> crosses the briny deep: and <i>she</i>
is left lamenting.”</p>
<p>“That is <i>indeed</i> appropriate!” she replied
mockingly, as he placed the song before her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>“And am <i>I</i> to do the lamenting? And who
for, if you please?”</p>
<p>She played the air once or twice through,
first in quick, and finally in slow, time; and
then gave us the whole song with as much
graceful ease as if she had been familiar with
it all her life:—</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">“He stept so lightly to the land,</p>
<p class="t">All in his manly pride:</p>
<p class="t0">He kissed her cheek, he pressed her hand,</p>
<p class="t">Yet still she glanced aside.</p>
<p class="t0">‘Too gay he seems,’ she darkly dreams,</p>
<p class="t">‘Too gallant and too gay</p>
<p class="t0">To think of me—poor simple me—</p>
<p class="t">When he is far away!’</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">‘I bring my Love this goodly pearl</p>

<p class="t0">‘A gem to deck the dearest girl</p>

<p class="t0">She clasps it tight: her eyes are bright:</p>
<p class="t">Her throbbing heart would say</p>
<p class="t0">‘He thought of me—he thought of me—</p>
<p class="t">When he was far away!’</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_292">292</div>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">Yet there’s a smile upon her face,</p>
<p class="t">A smile that seems to say</p>
<p class="t0">‘He’ll think of me—he’ll think of me—</p>

<p class="t">For ever and a day,</p>
<p class="t0">To think of me—to think of me—</p>
<p class="t">When he is far away!’”</p>
</div>
<p>The look of displeasure, which had begun
to come over Arthur’s face when the young
Captain spoke of Love so lightly, faded away
as the song proceeded, and he listened with
evident delight. But his face darkened again
when Eric demurely remarked “Don’t you
think ‘my <i>soldier</i>-lad’ would have fitted the
tune just as well!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_293">293</div>
<p>“Why, so it would!” Lady Muriel gaily
retorted. “Soldiers, sailors, tinkers, tailors,
what a lot of words would fit in! I think
‘my <i>tinker</i>-lad’ sounds best. Don’t <i>you</i>?”</p>
<p>To spare my friend further pain, I rose to
go, just as the Earl was beginning to repeat
his particularly embarrassing question about
the flowers.</p>
<p>“You have not yet——”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve <i>had</i> some tea, thank you!” I
hastily interrupted him. “And now we really
<i>must</i> be going. Good evening, Lady Muriel!”
And we made our adieux, and escaped, while
the Earl was still absorbed in examining the
mysterious bouquet.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel accompanied us to the door.
“You <i>couldn’t</i> have given my father a more
acceptable present!” she said, warmly. “He
is so passionately fond of Botany. I’m afraid
<i>I</i> know nothing of the <i>theory</i> of it, but I keep
his <i>Hortus Siccus</i> in order. I must get some
sheets of blotting-paper, and dry these new
treasures for him before they fade.”</p>
<p>“<i>That</i> won’t be no good at all!” said Bruno,
who was waiting for us in the garden.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<p>“Why won’t it?” said I. “You know I <i>had</i>
to give the flowers, to stop questions.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it ca’n’t be helped,” said Sylvie: “but
they <i>will</i> be sorry when they find them gone!”</p>
<p>“But how will they go?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know <i>how</i>. But they <i>will</i> go.
The nosegay was only a <i>Phlizz</i>, you know.
Bruno made it up.”</p>
<p>These last words were in a whisper, as she
evidently did not wish Arthur to hear. But of
this there seemed to be little risk: he hardly
seemed to notice the children, but paced on,
silent and abstracted; and when, at the entrance
to the wood, they bid us a hasty farewell and
ran off, he seemed to wake out of a day-dream.</p>
<p>The bouquet vanished, as Sylvie had predicted;
and when, a day or two afterwards,
Arthur and I once more visited the Hall, we
found the Earl and his daughter, with the old
housekeeper, out in the garden, examining the
fastenings of the drawing-room window.</p>
<p>“We are holding an Inquest,” Lady Muriel
said, advancing to meet us: “and we admit
you, as Accessories before the Fact, to tell us
all you know about those flowers.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_295">295</div>
<p>“The Accessories before the Fact decline to
answer <i>any</i> questions,” I gravely replied. “And
they reserve their defence.”</p>
<p>“Well then, turn Queen’s Evidence, please!
The flowers have disappeared in the night,”
she went on, turning to Arthur, “and we are
<i>quite</i> sure no one in the house has meddled
with them. Somebody must have entered by
the window——”</p>
<p>“But the fastenings have not been tampered
with,” said the Earl.</p>
<p>“It must have been while you were dining,
my Lady,” said the housekeeper.</p>
<p>“That was it,” said the Earl. “The thief
must have seen you bring the flowers,” turning
to me, “and have noticed that you did <i>not</i>
take them away. And he must have known
their great value—they are simply <i>priceless</i>!”
he exclaimed, in sudden excitement.</p>
<p>“And you never told us how you got them!”
said Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>“Some day,” I stammered, “I may be free
to tell you. Just now, would you excuse me?”</p>
<p>The Earl looked disappointed, but kindly
said “Very well, we will ask no questions.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>

<img src="images/i296.jpg" alt="FIVE O’CLOCK TEA" width="500" height="319" />
<p class="center small">FIVE O’CLOCK TEA</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
<p>“But we consider you a <i>very</i> bad Queen’s
Evidence,” Lady Muriel added playfully, as
we entered the arbour. “We pronounce you
to be an accomplice: and we sentence you to
solitary confinement, and to be fed on bread
and—butter. Do you take sugar?”</p>
<p>“It is disquieting, certainly,” she resumed,
when all ‘creature-comforts’ had been duly
supplied, “to find that the house has been
entered by a thief—in this out-of-the-way
place. If only the flowers had been <i>eatables</i>,
one might have suspected a thief of quite
another shape——”</p>
<p>“You mean that universal explanation for all
mysterious disappearances, ‘the <i>cat</i> did it’?”
said Arthur.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she replied. “What a convenient
thing it would be if all thieves had the same
shape! It’s so confusing to have some of
them quadrupeds and others bipeds!”</p>
<p>“It has occurred to me,” said Arthur, “as
a curious problem in Teleology—the Science
of Final Causes,” he added, in answer to an
enquiring look from Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>“And a Final Cause is——?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_298">298</div>
<p>“Well, suppose we say—the last of a series
of connected events—each of the series being
the cause of the next—for whose sake the first
event takes place.”</p>
<p>“But the last event is practically an <i>effect</i> of
the first, isn’t it? And yet you call it a <i>cause</i>
of it!”</p>
<p>Arthur pondered a moment. “The words
are rather confusing, I grant you,” he said.
“Will this do? The last event is an effect
of the first: but the <i>necessity</i> for that event is
a cause of the <i>necessity</i> for the first.”</p>
<p>“That seems clear enough,” said Lady
Muriel. “Now let us have the problem.”</p>
<p>“It’s merely this. What object can we
imagine in the arrangement by which each
different size (roughly speaking) of living creatures
has its special shape? For instance, the
human race has one kind of shape—bipeds.
Another set, ranging from the lion to the mouse,
are quadrupeds. Go down a step or two
further, and you come to insects with six legs—hexapods—a
beautiful name, is it not?
But beauty, in our sense of the word, seems to
diminish as we go down: the creature becomes
<span class="pb" id="Page_299">299</span>
more—I won’t say ‘ugly’ of any of God’s
creatures—more uncouth. And, when we take
the microscope, and go a few steps lower still,
we come upon animalculæ, terribly uncouth,
and with a terrible number of legs!”</p>
<p>“The other alternative,” said the Earl,
“would be a <i>diminuendo</i> series of repetitions
of the same type. Never mind the monotony
of it: let’s see how it would work in other
ways. Begin with the race of men, and the
creatures they require: let us say horses, cattle,
sheep, and dogs—we don’t exactly require
frogs and spiders, do we, Muriel?”</p>
<p>Lady Muriel shuddered perceptibly: it was
evidently a painful subject. “We can dispense
with <i>them</i>,” she said gravely.</p>
<p>“Well, then we’ll have a second race of men,
half-a-yard high——”</p>
<p>“—who would have <i>one</i> source of exquisite
enjoyment, not possessed by ordinary
men!” Arthur interrupted.</p>
<p>“<i>What</i> source?” said the Earl.</p>
<p>“Why, the grandeur of scenery! Surely
the grandeur of a mountain, to <i>me</i>, depends
on its <i>size</i>, relative to me? Double the height
<span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
of the mountain, and of course it’s twice as
grand. Halve <i>my</i> height, and you produce
the same effect.”</p>
<p>“Happy, happy, happy Small!” Lady Muriel
murmured rapturously. “None but the Short,
none but the Short, none but the Short enjoy
the Tall!”</p>
<p>“But let me go on,” said the Earl. “We’ll
have a third race of men, five inches high; a
fourth race, an inch high——”</p>
<p>“They couldn’t eat common beef and mutton,
I’m sure!” Lady Muriel interrupted.</p>
<p>“True, my child, I was forgetting. Each
set must have its own cattle and sheep.”</p>
<p>“And its own vegetation,” I added. “What
could a cow, an inch high, do with grass that
waved far above its head?”</p>
<p>“That is true. We must have a pasture
within a pasture, so to speak. The common
grass would serve our inch-high cows as a
green forest of palms, while round the root of
each tall stem would stretch a tiny carpet of
microscopic grass. Yes, I think our scheme
will work fairly well. And it would be very
interesting, coming into contact with the races
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
below us. What sweet little things the inch-high
bull-dogs would be! I doubt if even
<i>Muriel</i> would run away from one of them!”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think we ought to have a
<i>crescendo</i> series, as well?” said Lady Muriel.
“Only fancy being a hundred yards high!
One could use an elephant as a paper-weight,
and a crocodile as a pair of scissors!”</p>
<p>“And would you have races of different sizes
communicate with one another?” I enquired.
“Would they make war on one another, for
instance, or enter into treaties?”</p>
<p>“<i>War</i> we must exclude, I think. When you
could crush a whole nation with one blow of
your fist, you couldn’t conduct war on equal
terms. But anything, involving a collision of
<i>minds</i> only, would be possible in our ideal
world—for of course we must allow <i>mental</i>
powers to all, irrespective of size. Perhaps
the fairest rule would be that, the <i>smaller</i>
the race, the <i>greater</i> should be its intellectual
development!”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say,” said Lady Muriel,
“that these manikins of an inch high are to
<i>argue</i> with me?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<p>“Surely, surely!” said the Earl. “An argument
doesn’t depend for its logical force on
the <i>size</i> of the creature that utters it!”</p>
<p>She tossed her head indignantly. “I would
<i>not</i> argue with any man less than six inches
high!” she cried. “I’d make him <i>work</i>!”</p>
<p>“What at?” said Arthur, listening to all
this nonsense with an amused smile.</p>
<p>“<i>Embroidery!</i>” she readily replied. “What
<i>lovely</i> embroidery they would do!”</p>
<p>“Yet, if they did it wrong,” I said, “you
couldn’t <i>argue</i> the question. I don’t know
<i>why</i>: but I agree that it couldn’t be done.”</p>
<p>“The reason is,” said Lady Muriel, “one
couldn’t sacrifice one’s <i>dignity</i> so far.”</p>
<p>“Of course one couldn’t!” echoed Arthur.
“Any more than one could argue with a potato.
It would be altogether—excuse the ancient
pun—<i>infra dig.</i>!”</p>
<p>“I doubt it,” said I. “Even a pun doesn’t
<i>quite</i> convince me.”</p>
<p>“Well, if that is <i>not</i> the reason,” said Lady
Muriel, “what reason would you give?”</p>
<p>I tried hard to understand the meaning of
this question: but the persistent humming of
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
the bees confused me, and there was a drowsiness
in the air that made every thought stop
and go to sleep before it had got well thought
out: so all I could say was “That must depend
on the <i>weight</i> of the potato.”</p>
<p>I felt the remark was not so sensible as I
should have liked it to be. But Lady Muriel
seemed to take it quite as a matter of course.
“In that case——” she began, but suddenly
started, and turned away to listen. “Don’t
you hear him?” she said. “He’s crying. We
must go to him, somehow.”</p>
<p>And I said to myself “That’s very strange!
I quite thought it was <i>Lady Muriel</i> talking to
me. Why, it’s <i>Sylvie</i> all the while!” And I
made another great effort to say something
that should have some meaning in it. “Is it
about the potato?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><span class="small">THROUGH THE IVORY DOOR.</span></h2>
<p>“I don’t know,” said Sylvie. “Hush! I
must think. I could go to him, by myself, well
enough. But I want <i>you</i> to come too.”</p>
<p>“Let me go with you,” I pleaded. “I can
walk as fast as <i>you</i> can, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Sylvie laughed merrily. “What nonsense!”
she cried. “Why, you ca’n’t walk a bit! You’re
lying quite flat on your back! You don’t
understand these things.”</p>
<p>“I can walk as well as <i>you</i> can,” I repeated.
And I tried my best to walk a few steps: but
the ground slipped away backwards, quite as
<span class="pb" id="Page_305">305</span>
fast as I could walk, so that I made no progress
at all. Sylvie laughed again.</p>
<p>“There, I told you so! You’ve no idea how
funny you look, moving your feet about in the
air, as if you were walking! Wait a bit. I’ll
ask the Professor what we’d better do.” And
she knocked at his study-door.</p>
<p>The door opened, and the Professor looked
out. “What’s that crying I heard just now?”
he asked. “Is it a human animal?”</p>
<p>“It’s a boy,” Sylvie said.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid you’ve been teasing him?”</p>
<p>“No, <i>indeed</i> I haven’t!” Sylvie said, very
earnestly. “I <i>never</i> tease him!”</p>
<p>“Well, I must ask the Other Professor
about it.” He went back into the study, and
we heard him whispering “small human animal—says
she hasn’t been teasing him—the
kind that’s called Boy——”</p>
<p>“Ask her <i>which</i> Boy,” said a new voice.
The Professor came out again.</p>
<p>“<i>Which</i> Boy is it that you haven’t been
teasing?”</p>
<p>Sylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes.
“You dear old thing!” she exclaimed, standing
<span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
on tiptoe to kiss him, while he gravely
stooped to receive the salute. “How you <i>do</i>
puzzle me! Why, there are <i>several</i> boys I
haven’t been teasing!”</p>
<p>The Professor returned to his friend: and
this time the voice said “Tell her to bring
them here—<i>all</i> of them!”</p>
<p>“I ca’n’t, and I won’t!” Sylvie exclaimed, the
moment he reappeared. “It’s <i>Bruno</i> that’s
crying: and he’s my brother: and, please, we
<i>both</i> want to go: he ca’n’t walk, you know:
he’s—he’s <i>dreaming</i>, you know” (this in a
whisper, for fear of hurting my feelings). “<i>Do</i>
let’s go through the Ivory Door!”</p>
<p>“I’ll ask him,” said the Professor, disappearing
again. He returned directly. “He says
you may. Follow me, and walk on tip-toe.”</p>
<p>The difficulty with me would have been, just
then, <i>not</i> to walk on tip-toe. It seemed very
hard to reach down far enough to just touch
the floor, as Sylvie led me through the study.</p>
<p>The Professor went before us to unlock the
Ivory Door. I had just time to glance at the
Other Professor, who was sitting reading, with
his back to us, before the Professor showed us
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
out through the door, and locked it behind us.
Bruno was standing with his hands over his
face, crying bitterly.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig40">
<img src="images/i307.jpg" alt="‘WHAT’S THE MATTER, DARLING?’" width="500" height="691" />
<p class="center small">‘WHAT’S THE MATTER, DARLING?’</p>
</div>
<p>“What’s the matter, darling?” said Sylvie,
with her arms round his neck.</p>
<p>“Hurted mine self <i>welly</i> much!” sobbed
the poor little fellow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<p>“I’m <i>so</i> sorry, darling! How ever <i>did</i> you
manage to hurt yourself so?”</p>
<p>“Course I managed it!” said Bruno, laughing
through his tears. “Doos oo think nobody else
but <i>oo</i> ca’n’t manage things?”</p>
<p>Matters were looking distinctly brighter,
now Bruno had begun to argue. “Come,
let’s hear all about it!” I said.</p>
<p>“My foot took it into its head to slip——”
Bruno began.</p>
<p>“A foot hasn’t got a head!” Sylvie put in,
but all in vain.</p>
<p>“I slipted down the bank. And I tripted
over a stone. And the stone hurted my foot!
And I trod on a Bee. And the Bee stinged
my finger!” Poor Bruno sobbed again. The
complete list of woes was too much for his
feelings. “And it knewed I didn’t <i>mean</i> to
trod on it!” he added, as the climax.</p>
<p>“That Bee should be ashamed of itself!”
I said severely, and Sylvie hugged and kissed
the wounded hero till all tears were dried.</p>
<p>“My finger’s quite unstung now!” said
Bruno. “Why doos there be stones? Mister
Sir, doos oo know?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<p>“They’re good for <i>something</i>,” I said: “even
if we don’t know <i>what</i>. What’s the good of
<i>dandelions</i>, now?”</p>
<p>“Dindledums?” said Bruno. “Oh, they’re
ever so pretty! And stones aren’t pretty,
one bit. Would oo like some dindledums,
Mister Sir?”</p>
<p>“Bruno!” Sylvie murmured reproachfully.
“You mustn’t say ‘Mister’ and ‘Sir,’ both at
once! Remember what I told you!”</p>
<p>“You telled me I were to say ‘Mister’ when
I spoked <i>about</i> him, and I were to say ‘Sir’
when I spoked <i>to</i> him!”</p>
<p>“Well, you’re not doing <i>both</i>, you know.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but I <i>is</i> doing bofe, Miss Praticular!”
Bruno exclaimed triumphantly. “I wishted to
speak <i>about</i> the Gemplun—and I wishted to
speak <i>to</i> the Gemplun. So a course I said
‘Mister Sir’!”</p>
<p>“That’s all right, Bruno,” I said.</p>
<p>“<i>Course</i> it’s all right!” said Bruno. “Sylvie
just knows nuffin at all!”</p>
<p>“There never <i>was</i> an impertinenter boy!”
said Sylvie, frowning till her bright eyes were
nearly invisible.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
<p>“And there never was an ignoranter girl!”
retorted Bruno. “Come along and pick some
dindledums. <i>That’s all she’s fit for!</i>” he
added in a very loud whisper to me.</p>
<p>“But why do you say ‘Dindledums,’ Bruno?
<i>Dandelions</i> is the right word.”</p>
<p>“It’s because he jumps about so,” Sylvie
said, laughing.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s it,” Bruno assented. “Sylvie
tells me the words, and then, when I jump
about, they get shooken up in my head—till
they’re all froth!”</p>
<p>I expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with
this explanation. “But aren’t you going to pick
me any dindledums, after all?”</p>
<p>“Course we will!” cried Bruno. “Come
along, Sylvie!” And the happy children raced
away, bounding over the turf with the fleetness
and grace of young antelopes.</p>
<p>“Then you didn’t find your way back to
Outland?” I said to the Professor.</p>
<p>“Oh yes, I did!” he replied, “We never got
to Queer Street; but I found another way. I’ve
been backwards and forwards several times
since then. I had to be present at the Election,
<span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
you know, as the author of the new Money-Act.
The Emperor was so kind as to wish
that <i>I</i> should have the credit of it. ‘Let come
what come may,’ (I remember the very words
of the Imperial Speech) ‘if it <i>should</i> turn out
that the Warden <i>is</i> alive, <i>you</i> will bear witness
that the change in the coinage is the <i>Professor’s</i>
doing, not <i>mine</i>!’ I never was so glorified
in my life, before!” Tears trickled down his
cheeks at the recollection, which apparently
was not <i>wholly</i> a pleasant one.</p>
<p>“Is the Warden supposed to be <i>dead</i>?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s <i>supposed</i> so: but, mind you, <i>I</i>
don’t believe it! The evidence is <i>very</i> weak—mere
hear-say. A wandering Jester, with
a Dancing-Bear (they found their way into the
Palace, one day) has been telling people he
comes from Fairyland, and that the Warden
died there. <i>I</i> wanted the Vice-Warden to
question him, but, most unluckily, he and my
Lady were always out walking when the Jester
came round. Yes, the Warden’s supposed to
be dead!” And more tears trickled down the
old man’s cheeks.</p>
<p>“But what is the new Money-Act?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<p>The Professor brightened up again. “The
Emperor started the thing,” he said. “He
wanted to make everybody in Outland twice
as rich as he was before—just to make the
new Government popular. Only there wasn’t
nearly enough money in the Treasury to do it.
So <i>I</i> suggested that he might do it by doubling
the value of every coin and bank-note in Outland.
It’s the simplest thing possible. I wonder
nobody ever thought of it before! And you
never saw such universal joy. The shops are
full from morning to night. Everybody’s
buying everything!”</p>
<p>“And how was the glorifying done?”</p>
<p>A sudden gloom overcast the Professor’s
jolly face. “They did it as I went home
after the Election,” he mournfully replied. “It
was kindly meant—but I didn’t like it! They
waved flags all round me till I was nearly
blind: and they rang bells till I was nearly
deaf: and they strewed the road so thick with
flowers that I lost my way!” And the poor
old man sighed deeply.</p>
<p>“How far is it to Outland?” I asked, to
change the subject.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_313">313</div>
<p>“About five days’ march. But one <i>must</i> go
back—occasionally. You see, as Court-Professor,
I have to be <i>always</i> in attendance on
Prince Uggug. The Empress would be <i>very</i>
angry if I left him, even for an hour.”</p>
<p>“But surely, every time you come here, you
are absent ten days, at least?”</p>
<p>“Oh, more than that!” the Professor exclaimed.
“A fortnight, sometimes. But of
course I keep a memorandum of the exact time
when I started, so that I can put the Court-time
back to the very moment!”</p>
<p>“Excuse me,” I said. “I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Silently the Professor drew from his pocket a
square gold watch, with six or eight hands, and
held it out for my inspection. “This,” he began,
“is an Outlandish Watch——”</p>
<p>“So I should have thought.”</p>
<p>“—which has the peculiar property that,
instead of <i>its</i> going with the <i>time</i>, the <i>time</i> goes
with <i>it</i>. I trust you understand me now?”</p>
<p>“Hardly,” I said.</p>
<p>“Permit me to explain. So long as it is let
alone, it takes its own course. Time has <i>no</i>
effect upon it.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_314">314</div>
<p>“I have known such watches,” I remarked.</p>
<p>“It <i>goes</i>, of course, at the usual rate. Only
the time has to go <i>with</i> it. Hence, if I move
the hands, I change the time. To move them <i>forwards</i>,
in <i>advance</i> of the true time, is impossible:
but I can move them as much as a month <i>backwards</i>—that
is the limit. And then you have
the events all over again—with any alterations
experience may suggest.”</p>
<p>“<i>What</i> a blessing such a watch would be,”
I thought, “in real life! To be able to unsay
some heedless word—to undo some reckless
deed! Might I see the thing done?”</p>
<p>“With pleasure!” said the good natured
Professor. “When I move <i>this</i> hand back to
<i>here</i>,” pointing out the place, “History goes
back fifteen minutes!”</p>
<p>Trembling with excitement, I watched him
push the hand round as he described.</p>
<p>“Hurted mine self <i>welly</i> much!”</p>
<p>Shrilly and suddenly the words rang in my
ears, and, more startled than I cared to show, I
turned to look for the speaker.</p>
<p>Yes! There was Bruno, standing with the
tears running down his cheeks, just as I had
<span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
seen him a quarter of an hour ago; and there
was Sylvie with her arms round his neck!</p>
<p>I had not the heart to make the dear little
fellow go through his troubles a second time,
so hastily begged the Professor to push the
hands round into their former position. In a
moment Sylvie and Bruno were gone again,
and I could just see them in the far distance,
picking ‘dindledums.’</p>
<p>“Wonderful, indeed!” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“It has another property, yet more wonderful,”
said the Professor. “You see this little
peg? That is called the ‘Reversal Peg.’ If
you push it in, the events of the next hour happen
in the reverse order. Do not try it now.
I will lend you the Watch for a few days, and
you can amuse yourself with experiments.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much!” I said as he gave
me the Watch. “I’ll take the greatest care of
it—why, here are the children again!”</p>
<p>“We could only but find <i>six</i> dindledums,”
said Bruno, putting them into my hands,
“’cause Sylvie said it were time to go back.
And here’s a big blackberry for <i>ooself</i>! We
couldn’t only find but <i>two</i>!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>“Thank you: it’s <i>very</i> nice,” I said. “And
I suppose <i>you</i> ate the other, Bruno?”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t,” Bruno said, carelessly.
“<i>Aren’t</i> they pretty dindledums, Mister Sir?”</p>
<p>“Yes, very: but what makes you limp so,
my child?”</p>
<p>“Mine foot’s come <i>hurted</i> again!” Bruno
mournfully replied. And he sat down on the
ground, and began nursing it.</p>
<p>The Professor held his head between his
hands—an attitude that I knew indicated distraction
of mind. “Better rest a minute,” he
said. “It may be better then—or it may be
worse. If only I had some of my medicines
here! I’m Court-Physician, you know,” he
added, aside to me.</p>
<p>“Shall I go and get you some blackberries,
darling?” Sylvie whispered, with her arms
round his neck; and she kissed away a tear
that was trickling down his cheek.</p>
<p>Bruno brightened up in a moment. “That
<i>are</i> a good plan!” he exclaimed. “I thinks my
foot would come <i>quite</i> unhurted, if I eated a
blackberry—two or three blackberries—six
or seven blackberries—”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_317">317</div>
<p>Sylvie got up hastily. “I’d better go,” she
said, aside to me, “before he gets into the
double figures!”</p>
<p>“Let me come and help you,” I said. “I
can reach higher up than you can.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please,” said Sylvie, putting her hand
into mine: and we walked off together.</p>
<p>“Bruno <i>loves</i> blackberries,” she said, as we
paced slowly along by a tall hedge, that looked
a promising place for them, “and it was so
<i>sweet</i> of him to make me eat the only one!”</p>
<p>“Oh, it was <i>you</i> that ate it, then? Bruno
didn’t seem to like to tell me about it.”</p>
<p>“No; I saw that,” said Sylvie. “He’s
always afraid of being praised. But he <i>made</i>
me eat it, really! I would much rather he—oh,
what’s that?” And she clung to my
hand, half-frightened, as we came in sight of a
hare, lying on its side with legs stretched out,
just in the entrance to the wood.</p>
<p>“It’s a <i>hare</i>, my child. Perhaps it’s asleep.”</p>
<p>“No, it isn’t asleep,” Sylvie said, timidly
going nearer to look at it: “it’s eyes are open.
Is it—is it—” her voice dropped to an awestruck
whisper, “is it <i>dead</i>, do you think?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_318">318</div>
<p>“Yes, it’s quite dead,” I said, after stooping
to examine it. “Poor thing! I think it’s been
hunted to death. I know the harriers were out
yesterday. But they haven’t touched it. Perhaps
they caught sight of another, and left it
to die of fright and exhaustion.”</p>
<p>“Hunted to <i>death</i>?” Sylvie repeated to herself,
very slowly and sadly. “I thought hunting
was a thing they <i>played</i> at—like a game.
Bruno and I hunt snails: but we never hurt
them when we catch them!”</p>
<p>“Sweet angel!” I thought. “How am I
to get the idea of <i>Sport</i> into your innocent
mind?” And as we stood, hand-in-hand, looking
down at the dead hare, I tried to put the
thing into such words as she could understand.
“You know what fierce wild-beasts
lions and tigers are?” Sylvie nodded. “Well,
in some countries men <i>have</i> to kill them, to
save their own lives, you know.”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Sylvie: “if one tried to kill
<i>me</i>, Bruno would kill <i>it</i>—if he could.”</p>
<p>“Well, and so the men—the hunters—get
to enjoy it, you know: the running, and the
fighting, and the shouting, and the danger.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<p>“Yes,” said Sylvie. “Bruno likes danger.”</p>
<p>“Well, but, in <i>this</i> country, there aren’t any
lions and tigers, loose: so they hunt other
creatures, you see.” I hoped, but in vain, that
this would satisfy her, and that she would ask
no more questions.</p>
<p>“They hunt <i>foxes</i>,” Sylvie said, thoughtfully.
“And I think they <i>kill</i> them, too. Foxes are
very fierce. I daresay men don’t love them.
Are hares fierce?”</p>
<p>“No,” I said. “A hare is a sweet, gentle,
timid animal—almost as gentle as a lamb.”</p>
<p>“But, if men <i>love</i> hares, why—why—” her
voice quivered, and her sweet eyes were brimming
over with tears.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid they <i>don’t</i> love them, dear child.”</p>
<p>“All <i>children</i> love them,” Sylvie said. “All
ladies love them.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid even <i>ladies</i> go to hunt them,
sometimes.”</p>
<p>Sylvie shuddered. “Oh, no, not <i>ladies</i>!”
she earnestly pleaded. “Not Lady Muriel!”</p>
<p>“No, <i>she</i> never does, I’m sure—but this is
too sad a sight for <i>you</i>, dear. Let’s try and
find some—”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
<p>But Sylvie was not satisfied yet. In a
hushed, solemn tone, with bowed head and
clasped hands, she put her final question.
“Does <span class="sc">God</span> love hares?”</p>
<p>“Yes!” I said. “I’m <i>sure</i> He does! He
loves every living thing. Even sinful <i>men</i>.
How much more the animals, that cannot sin!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what ‘sin’ means,” said
Sylvie. And I didn’t try to explain it.</p>
<p>“Come, my child,” I said, trying to lead her
away. “Wish good-bye to the poor hare, and
come and look for blackberries.”</p>
<p>“Good-bye, poor hare!” Sylvie obediently
repeated, looking over her shoulder at it as we
turned away. And then, all in a moment, her
self-command gave way. Pulling her hand out
of mine, she ran back to where the dead hare
was lying, and flung herself down at its side in
such an agony of grief as I could hardly have
believed possible in so young a child.</p>
<p>“Oh, my darling, my darling!” she moaned,
over and over again. “And <span class="sc">God</span> meant your
life to be so beautiful!”</p>
<p>Sometimes, but always keeping her face hidden
on the ground, she would reach out one
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
little hand, to stroke the poor dead thing, and
then once more bury her face in her hands, and
sob as if her heart would break.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig41">
<img src="images/i321.jpg" alt="THE DEAD HARE" width="500" height="349" />
<p class="center small">THE DEAD HARE</p>
</div>
<p>I was afraid she would really make herself
ill: still I thought it best to let her weep away
the first sharp agony of grief: and, after a
few minutes, the sobbing gradually ceased, and
Sylvie rose to her feet, and looked calmly at
me, though tears were still streaming down
her cheeks.</p>
<p>I did not dare to speak again, just yet; but
simply held out my hand to her, that we might
quit the melancholy spot.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
<p>“Yes, I’ll come now,” she said. Very reverently
she kneeled down, and kissed the dead
hare; then rose and gave me her hand, and we
moved on in silence.</p>
<p>A child’s sorrow is violent, but short; and it
was almost in her usual voice that she said,
after a minute, “Oh stop, stop! Here are some
<i>lovely</i> blackberries!”</p>
<p>We filled our hands with fruit, and returned
in all haste to where the Professor and Bruno
were seated on a bank, awaiting our return.</p>
<p>Just before we came within hearing-distance,
Sylvie checked me. “Please don’t tell <i>Bruno</i>
about the hare!” she said.</p>
<p>“Very well, my child. But why not?”</p>
<p>Tears again glittered in those sweet eyes,
and she turned her head away, so that I could
scarcely hear her reply. “He’s—he’s very
<i>fond</i> of gentle creatures, you know. And he’d—he’d
be so sorry! I don’t want him to be
made sorry.”</p>
<p>“And <i>your</i> agony of sorrow is to count for
nothing, then, sweet unselfish child!” I thought
to myself. But no more was said till we had
reached our friends; and Bruno was far too
<span class="pb" id="Page_323">323</span>
much engrossed, in the feast we had brought
him, to take any notice of Sylvie’s unusually
grave manner.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid it’s getting rather late, Professor?”
I said.</p>
<p>“Yes, indeed,” said the Professor. “I must
take you all through the Ivory Door again.
You’ve stayed your full time.”</p>
<p>“Mightn’t we stay a <i>little</i> longer!” pleaded
Sylvie.</p>
<p>“Just <i>one</i> minute!” added Bruno.</p>
<p>But the Professor was unyielding. “It’s a
great privilege, coming through at all,” he said.
“We must go now.” And we followed him
obediently to the Ivory Door, which he threw
open, and signed to me to go through first.</p>
<p>“You’re coming too, aren’t you?” I said to
Sylvie.</p>
<p>“Yes,” she said: “but you won’t see us after
you’ve gone through.”</p>
<p>“But suppose I wait for you outside?” I
asked, as I stepped through the doorway.</p>
<p>“In that case,” said Sylvie, “I think the
potato would be <i>quite</i> justified in asking <i>your</i>
weight. I can quite imagine a really <i>superior</i>
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
kidney-potato declining to argue with any
one under <i>fifteen stone</i>!”</p>
<p>With a great effort I recovered the thread
of my thoughts. “We lapse very quickly into
nonsense!” I said.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
<h2 id="c22">CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><span class="small">CROSSING THE LINE.</span></h2>
<p>“Let us lapse back again,” said Lady
Muriel. “Take another cup of tea? I hope
<i>that’s</i> sound common sense?”</p>
<p>“And all that strange adventure,” I thought,
“has occupied the space of a single comma in
Lady Muriel’s speech! A single comma, for
which grammarians tell us to ‘count <i>one</i>’!” (I
felt no doubt that the Professor had kindly put
back the time for me, to the exact point at
which I had gone to sleep.)</p>
<p>When, a few minutes afterwards, we left the
house, Arthur’s first remark was certainly a
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
strange one. “We’ve been there just <i>twenty
minutes</i>,” he said, “and I’ve done nothing but
listen to you and Lady Muriel talking: and
yet, somehow, I feel exactly as if <i>I</i> had been
talking with her for an <i>hour</i> at least!”</p>
<p>And so he <i>had</i> been, I felt no doubt: only,
as the time had been put back to the beginning
of the tête-à-tête he referred to, the whole of
it had passed into oblivion, if not into nothingness!
But I valued my own reputation for
sanity too highly to venture on explaining to
<i>him</i> what had happened.</p>
<p>For some cause, which I could not at the
moment divine, Arthur was unusually grave
and silent during our walk home. It could not
be connected with Eric Lindon, I thought, as
he had for some days been away in London:
so that, having Lady Muriel almost ‘all to
himself’—for <i>I</i> was only too glad to hear
those two conversing, to have any wish to
intrude any remarks of my own—he <i>ought</i>,
theoretically, to have been specially radiant
and contented with life. “Can he have heard
any bad news?” I said to myself. And, almost
as if he had read my thoughts, he spoke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_327">327</div>
<p>“He will be here by the last train,” he said,
in the tone of one who is continuing a conversation
rather than beginning one.</p>
<p>“Captain Lindon, do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Yes—Captain Lindon,” said Arthur: “I
said ‘he,’ because I fancied we were talking
about him. The Earl told me he comes to-night,
though <i>to-morrow</i> is the day when he
will know about the Commission that he’s
hoping for. I wonder he doesn’t stay another
day to hear the result, if he’s really so anxious
about it as the Earl believes he is.”</p>
<p>“He can have a telegram sent after him,”
I said: “but it’s not very soldier-like, running
away from possible bad news!”</p>
<p>“He’s a very good fellow,” said Arthur:
“but I confess it would be good news for <i>me</i>,
if he got his Commission, and his Marching
Orders, all at once! I wish him all happiness—with
<i>one</i> exception. Good night!” (We
had reached home by this time.) “I’m not
good company to-night—better be alone.”</p>
<p>It was much the same, next day. Arthur
declared he wasn’t fit for Society, and I had
to set forth alone for an afternoon-stroll. I
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
took the road to the Station, and, at the point
where the road from the ‘Hall’ joined it, I
paused, seeing my friends in the distance,
seemingly bound for the same goal.</p>
<p>“Will you join us?” the Earl said, after I
had exchanged greetings with him, and Lady
Muriel, and Captain Lindon. “This restless
young man is expecting a telegram, and we
are going to the Station to meet it.”</p>
<p>“There is also a restless young woman in
the case,” Lady Muriel added.</p>
<p>“That goes without saying, my child,” said
her father. “Women are <i>always</i> restless!”</p>
<p>“For generous appreciation of all one’s <i>best</i>
qualities,” his daughter impressively remarked,
“there’s nothing to compare with a father, is
there, Eric?”</p>
<p>“Cousins are not ‘in it,’” said Eric: and
then somehow the conversation lapsed into
two duologues, the younger folk taking the
lead, and the two old men following with less
eager steps.</p>
<p>“And when are we to see your little friends
again?” said the Earl. “They are singularly
attractive children.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_329">329</div>
<p>“I shall be delighted to bring them, when
I can,” I said. “But I don’t know, myself,
when I am likely to see them again.”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to question you,” said the
Earl: “but there’s no harm in mentioning that
Muriel is simply tormented with curiosity!
We know most of the people about here,
and she has been vainly trying to guess what
house they can possibly be staying at.”</p>
<p>“Some day I may be able to enlighten her:
but just at present——”</p>
<p>“Thanks. She must bear it as best she
can. <i>I</i> tell her it’s a grand opportunity for
practising <i>patience</i>. But she hardly sees it
from that point of view. Why, there <i>are</i>
the children!”</p>
<p>So indeed they were: waiting (for <i>us</i>, apparently)
at a stile, which they could not have
climbed over more than a few moments, as
Lady Muriel and her cousin had passed it
without seeing them. On catching sight of us,
Bruno ran to meet us, and to exhibit to us,
with much pride, the handle of a clasp-knife—the
blade having been broken off—which
he had picked up in the road.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_330">330</div>
<p>“And what shall you use it for, Bruno?”
I said.</p>
<p>“Don’t know,” Bruno carelessly replied:
“must think.”</p>
<p>“A child’s first view of life,” the Earl
remarked, with that sweet sad smile of his,
“is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating
portable property. That view gets
modified as the years glide away.” And he
held out his hand to Sylvie, who had placed
herself by me, looking a little shy of him.</p>
<p>But the gentle old man was not one with
whom any child, human or fairy, could be shy
for long; and she had very soon deserted my
hand for his—Bruno alone remaining faithful
to his first friend. We overtook the other
couple just as they reached the Station, and
both Lady Muriel and Eric greeted the children
as old friends—the latter with the words “So
you got to Babylon by candlelight, after all?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and back again!” cried Bruno.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel looked from one to the other
in blank astonishment. “What, <i>you</i> know
them, Eric?” she exclaimed. “This mystery
grows deeper every day!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_331">331</div>
<p>“Then we must be somewhere in the Third
Act,” said Eric. “You don’t expect the
mystery to be cleared up till the Fifth Act,
do you?”</p>
<p>“But it’s such a <i>long</i> drama!” was the
plaintive reply. “We <i>must</i> have got to the
Fifth Act by this time!”</p>
<p>“<i>Third</i> Act, I assure you,” said the young
soldier mercilessly. “Scene, a railway-platform.
Lights down. Enter Prince (in disguise, of
course) and faithful Attendant. <i>This</i> is the
Prince—” (taking Bruno’s hand) “and here
stands his humble Servant! What is your
Royal Highness’s next command?” And he
made a most courtier-like low bow to his
puzzled little friend.</p>
<p>“Oo’re <i>not</i> a Servant!” Bruno scornfully
exclaimed. “Oo’re a <i>Gemplun</i>!”</p>
<p>“<i>Servant</i>, I assure your Royal Highness!”
Eric respectfully insisted. “Allow me to
mention to your Royal Highness my various
situations—past, present, and future.”</p>
<p>“What did oo begin wiz?” Bruno asked,
beginning to enter into the jest. “Was oo
a shoe-black?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">332</div>
<p>“Lower than that, your Royal Highness!
Years ago, I offered myself as a <i>Slave</i>—as
a ‘<i>Confidential</i> Slave,’ I think it’s called?” he
asked, turning to Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>But Lady Muriel heard him not: something
had gone wrong with her glove, which entirely
engrossed her attention.</p>
<p>“Did oo get the place?” said Bruno.</p>
<p>“Sad to say, Your Royal Highness, I did
<i>not</i>! So I had to take a situation as—as
<i>Waiter</i>, which I have now held for some
years—haven’t I?” He again glanced at
Lady Muriel.</p>
<p>“Sylvie dear, <i>do</i> help me to button this
glove!” Lady Muriel whispered, hastily stooping
down, and failing to hear the question.</p>
<p>“And what will oo be <i>next</i>?” said Bruno.</p>
<p>“My next place will, I hope, be that of
<i>Groom</i>. And after that——”</p>
<p>“Don’t puzzle the child so!” Lady Muriel
interrupted. “What nonsense you talk!”</p>
<p>“—after that,” Eric persisted, “I hope to
obtain the situation of <i>Housekeeper</i>, which—<i>Fourth
Act!</i>” he proclaimed, with a sudden
change of tone. “Lights turned up. Red
<span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
lights. Green lights. Distant rumble heard.
Enter a passenger-train!”</p>
<p>And in another minute the train drew up
alongside of the platform, and a stream of
passengers began to flow out from the booking
office and waiting-rooms.</p>
<p>“Did you ever make <i>real</i> life into a drama?”
said the Earl. “Now just try. I’ve often
amused myself that way. Consider this platform
as our stage. Good entrances and exits
on <i>both</i> sides, you see. Capital background
scene: real engine moving up and down. All
this bustle, and people passing to and fro, must
have been most carefully rehearsed! How
naturally they do it! With never a glance at
the audience! And every grouping is quite
fresh, you see. No repetition!”</p>
<p>It really was admirable, as soon as I began
to enter into it from this point of view. Even
a porter passing, with a barrow piled with
luggage, seemed so realistic that one was
tempted to applaud. He was followed by an
angry mother, with hot red face, dragging along
two screaming children, and calling, to some
one behind, “John! Come on!” Enter John,
<span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
very meek, very silent, and loaded with parcels.
And he was followed, in his turn, by a frightened
little nursemaid, carrying a fat baby, also
screaming. All the children screamed.</p>
<p>“Capital byplay!” said the old man aside.
“Did you notice the nursemaid’s look of
terror? It was simply <i>perfect</i>!”</p>
<p>“You have struck quite a new vein,” I said.
“To most of us Life and its pleasures seem
like a mine that is nearly worked out.”</p>
<p>“Worked out!” exclaimed the Earl. “For
any one with true dramatic instincts, it is only
the Overture that is ended! The real treat
has yet to begin. You go to a theatre, and pay
your ten shillings for a stall, and what do you
get for your money? Perhaps it’s a dialogue
between a couple of farmers—unnatural in
their overdone caricature of farmers’ dress—more
unnatural in their constrained attitudes
and gestures—most unnatural in their attempts
at ease and geniality in their talk. Go instead
and take a seat in a third-class railway-carriage,
and you’ll get the same dialogue done <i>to the
life</i>! Front-seats—no orchestra to block the
view—and nothing to pay!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_335">335</div>
<p>“Which reminds me,” said Eric. “There
is nothing to pay on receiving a telegram!
Shall we enquire for one?” And he and
Lady Muriel strolled off in the direction of
the Telegraph-Office.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Shakespeare had that thought
in his mind,” I said, “when he wrote ‘All the
world’s a stage’?”</p>
<p>The old man sighed. “And so it is,” he
said, “look at it as you will. Life is indeed
a drama; a drama with but few <i>encores</i>—and
no <i>bouquets</i>!” he added dreamily. “We
spend one half of it in regretting the things
we did in the other half!”</p>
<p>“And the secret of <i>enjoying</i> it,” he continued,
resuming his cheerful tone, “is <i>intensity</i>!”</p>
<p>“But not in the modern æsthetic sense, I
presume? Like the young lady, in Punch, who
begins a conversation with ‘Are you <i>intense</i>?’”</p>
<p>“By no means!” replied the Earl. “What
I mean is intensity of <i>thought</i>—a concentrated
<i>attention</i>. We lose half the pleasure we might
have in Life, by not really <i>attending</i>. Take
any instance you like: it doesn’t matter <i>how</i>
trivial the pleasure may be—the principle is
<span class="pb" id="Page_336">336</span>
the same. Suppose <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are reading the
same second-rate circulating-library novel. <i>A</i>
never troubles himself to master the relationships
of the characters, on which perhaps all
the interest of the story depends: he ‘skips’
over all the descriptions of scenery, and every
passage that looks rather dull: he doesn’t half
attend to the passages he does read: he goes
on reading—merely from want of resolution to
find another occupation—for hours after he
ought to have put the book aside: and reaches
the ‘<span class="small">FINIS</span>’ in a state of utter weariness and
depression! <i>B</i> puts his whole soul <i>into</i> the
thing—on the principle that ‘whatever is
worth doing is worth doing <i>well</i>’: he masters
the genealogies: he calls up pictures before
his ‘mind’s eye’ as he reads about the scenery:
best of all, he resolutely shuts the book at the
end of some chapter, while his interest is yet at
its keenest, and turns to other subjects; so
that, when next he allows himself an hour at
it, it is like a hungry man sitting down to
dinner: and, when the book is finished, he
returns to the work of his daily life like ‘a
giant refreshed’!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_337">337</div>
<p>“But suppose the book were really <i>rubbish</i>—nothing
to repay attention?”</p>
<p>“Well, suppose it,” said the Earl. “My
theory meets <i>that</i> case, I assure you! <i>A</i> never
finds out that it <i>is</i> rubbish, but maunders on
to the end, trying to believe he’s enjoying
himself. <i>B</i> quietly shuts the book, when he’s
read a dozen pages, walks off to the Library,
and changes it for a better! I have yet
<i>another</i> theory for adding to the enjoyment of
Life—that is, if I have not exhausted your
patience? I’m afraid you find me a very
garrulous old man.”</p>
<p>“No indeed!” I exclaimed earnestly. And
indeed I felt as if one <i>could</i> not easily tire
of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice.</p>
<p>“It is, that we should learn to take our
pleasures <i>quickly</i>, and our pains <i>slowly</i>.”</p>
<p>“But why? I should have put it the other
way, myself.”</p>
<p>“By taking <i>artificial</i> pain—which can be
as trivial as you please—<i>slowly</i>, the result
is that, when <i>real</i> pain comes, however severe,
all you need do is to let it go at its <i>ordinary</i>
pace, and it’s over in a moment!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_338">338</div>
<p>“Very true,” I said, “but how about the
<i>pleasure</i>?”</p>
<p>“Why, by taking it quick, you can get so
much more into life. It takes <i>you</i> three hours
and a half to hear and enjoy an opera. Suppose
<i>I</i> can take it in, and enjoy it, in half-an-hour.
Why, I can enjoy <i>seven</i> operas, while
you are listening to <i>one</i>!”</p>
<p>“Always supposing you have an orchestra
capable of <i>playing</i> them,” I said. “And that
orchestra has yet to be found!”</p>
<p>The old man smiled. “I have heard an
air played,” he said, “and by no means a
short one—played right through, variations
and all, in three seconds!”</p>
<p>“When? And how?” I asked eagerly, with
a half-notion that I was dreaming again.</p>
<p>“It was done by a little musical-box,” he
quietly replied. “After it had been wound
up, the regulator, or something, broke, and
it ran down, as I said, in about three seconds.
But it <i>must</i> have played all the notes, you
know!”</p>
<p>“Did you <i>enjoy</i> it?” I asked, with all the
severity of a cross-examining barrister.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_339">339</div>
<p>“No, I didn’t!” he candidly confessed.
“But then, you know, I hadn’t been trained
to that kind of music!”</p>
<p>“I should much like to <i>try</i> your plan,” I said,
and, as Sylvie and Bruno happened to run up
to us at the moment, I left them to keep the
Earl company, and strolled along the platform,
making each person and event play its part
in an <i>extempore</i> drama for my especial benefit.
“What, is the Earl tired of you already?” I
said, as the children ran past me.</p>
<p>“No!” Sylvie replied with great emphasis.
“He wants the evening-paper. So Bruno’s
going to be a little news-boy!”</p>
<p>“Mind you charge a good price for it!” I
called after them.</p>
<p>Returning up the platform, I came upon
Sylvie alone. “Well, child,” I said, “where’s
your little news-boy? Couldn’t he get you an
evening-paper?”</p>
<p>“He went to get one at the book-stall at
the other side,” said Sylvie; “and he’s coming
across the line with it—oh, Bruno, you ought
to cross by the bridge!” for the distant thud,
thud, of the Express was already audible.
<span class="pb" id="Page_340">340</span>
Suddenly a look of horror came over her face.
“Oh, he’s fallen down on the rails!” she cried,
and darted past me at a speed that quite defied
the hasty effort I made to stop her.</p>
<p>But the wheezy old Station-Master happened
to be close behind me: he wasn’t good for
much, poor old man, but he was good for this;
and, before I could turn round, he had the child
clasped in his arms, saved from the certain
death she was rushing to. So intent was I in
watching this scene, that I hardly saw a flying
figure in a light grey suit, who shot across from
the back of the platform, and was on the line in
another second. So far as one could take note
of time in such a moment of horror he had
about ten clear seconds, before the Express
would be upon him, in which to cross the rails
and to pick up Bruno. Whether he did so or
not it was quite impossible to guess: the next
thing one knew was that the Express had
passed, and that, whether for life or death, all
was over. When the cloud of dust had cleared
away, and the line was once more visible, we
saw with thankful hearts that the child and his
deliverer were safe.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
<p>“All right!” Eric called to us cheerfully,
as he recrossed the line. “He’s more frightened
than hurt!”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig42">
<img src="images/i341.jpg" alt="CROSSING THE LINE" width="500" height="418" />
<p class="center small">CROSSING THE LINE</p>
</div>
<p>He lifted the little fellow up into Lady
Muriel’s arms, and mounted the platform as
gaily as if nothing had happened: but he was
as pale as death, and leaned heavily on the
arm I hastily offered him, fearing he was about
to faint. “I’ll just—sit down a moment—”
he said dreamily: “—where’s Sylvie?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
<p>Sylvie ran to him, and flung her arms round
his neck, sobbing as if her heart would break.
“Don’t do that, my darling!” Eric murmured,
with a strange look in his eyes. “Nothing to
cry about now, you know. But you very nearly
got yourself killed for nothing!”</p>
<p>“For Bruno!” the little maiden sobbed.
“And he would have done it for me. Wouldn’t
you, Bruno?”</p>
<p>“Course I would!” Bruno said, looking
round with a bewildered air.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel kissed him in silence as she put
him down out of her arms. Then she beckoned
Sylvie to come and take his hand, and signed
to the children to go back to where the Earl
was seated. “Tell him,” she whispered with
quivering lips, “tell him—all is well!” Then
she turned to the hero of the day. “I thought
it was <i>death</i>,” she said. “Thank God, you are
safe! Did you see how near it was?”</p>
<p>“I saw there was just time,” Eric said lightly.
“A soldier must learn to carry his life in his
hand, you know. I’m all right now. Shall we
go to the telegraph-office again? I daresay
it’s come by this time.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_343">343</div>
<p>I went to join the Earl and the children, and
we waited—almost in silence, for no one
seemed inclined to talk, and Bruno was half-asleep
on Sylvie’s lap—till the others joined
us. No telegram had come.</p>
<p>“I’ll take a stroll with the children,” I said,
feeling that we were a little <i>de trop</i>, “and I’ll
look in, in the course of the evening.”</p>
<p>“We must go back into the wood, now,”
Sylvie said, as soon as we were out of hearing.
“We ca’n’t stay this size any longer.”</p>
<p>“Then you will be quite tiny Fairies again,
next time we meet?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Sylvie: “but we’ll be children
again some day—if you’ll let us. Bruno’s
very anxious to see Lady Muriel again.”</p>
<p>“She are <i>welly</i> nice,” said Bruno.</p>
<p>“I shall be very glad to take you to see her
again,” I said. “Hadn’t I better give you back
the Professor’s Watch? It’ll be too large for
you to carry when you’re Fairies, you know.”</p>
<p>Bruno laughed merrily. I was glad to see
he had quite recovered from the terrible scene
he had gone through. “Oh no, it won’t!” he
said. “When <i>we</i> go small, <i>it’ll</i> go small!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_344">344</div>
<p>“And then it’ll go straight to the Professor,”
Sylvie added, “and you won’t be able to use it
any more: so you’d better use it all you can,
<i>now</i>. We <i>must</i> go small when the sun sets.
Good-bye!”</p>
<p>“Good-bye!” cried Bruno. But their voices
sounded very far away, and, when I looked
round, both children had disappeared.</p>
<p>“And it wants only two hours to sunset!”
I said as I strolled on. “I must make the best
of my time!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_345">345</div>
<h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><span class="small">AN OUTLANDISH WATCH.</span></h2>
<p>As I entered the little town, I came upon
two of the fishermen’s wives interchanging
that last word “which never was the last”:
and it occurred to me, as an experiment with
the Magic Watch, to wait till the little scene
was over, and then to ‘encore’ it.</p>
<p>“Well, good night t’ye! And ye winna
forget to send us word when your Martha
writes?”</p>
<p>“Nay, ah winna forget. An’ if she isn’t
suited, she can but coom back. Good night
t’ye!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_346">346</div>
<p>A casual observer might have thought “and
there ends the dialogue!” That casual observer
would have been mistaken.</p>
<p>“Ah, she’ll like ’em, I war’n’ ye! <i>They’ll</i>
not treat her bad, yer may depend. They’re
varry canny fowk. Good night!”</p>
<p>“Ay, they <i>are</i> that! Good night!”</p>
<p>“Good night! And ye’ll send us word if
she writes?”</p>
<p>“Aye, ah will, yer may depend! Good
night t’ye!”</p>
<p>And at last they parted. I waited till they
were some twenty yards apart, and then put
the Watch a minute back. The instantaneous
change was startling: the two figures seemed
to flash back into their former places.</p>
<p>“—isn’t suited, she can but coom back.
Good night t’ye!” one of them was saying:
and so the whole dialogue was repeated, and,
when they had parted for the second time, I
let them go their several ways, and strolled
on through the town.</p>
<p>“But the real usefulness of this magic
power,” I thought, “would be to undo some
harm, some painful event, some accident——”
<span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
I had not long to wait for an opportunity of
testing <i>this</i> property also of the Magic Watch,
for, even as the thought passed through my
mind, the accident I was imagining occurred.
A light cart was standing at the door of the
‘Great Millinery Depôt’ of Elveston, laden
with card-board packing-cases, which the driver
was carrying into the shop, one by one. One
of the cases had fallen into the street, but it
scarcely seemed worth while to step forward
and pick it up, as the man would be back
again in a moment. Yet, in that moment, a
young man riding a bicycle came sharp round
the corner of the street and, in trying to avoid
running over the box, upset his machine, and
was thrown headlong against the wheel of the
spring-cart. The driver ran out to his assistance,
and he and I together raised the unfortunate
cyclist and carried him into the shop.
His head was cut and bleeding; and one knee
seemed to be badly injured; and it was speedily
settled that he had better be conveyed at once
to the only Surgery in the place. I helped
them in emptying the cart, and placing in it
some pillows for the wounded man to rest on;
<span class="pb" id="Page_348">348</span>
and it was only when the driver had mounted
to his place, and was starting for the Surgery,
that I bethought me of the strange power I
possessed of undoing all this harm.</p>
<p>“Now is my time!” I said to myself, as I
moved back the hand of the Watch, and saw,
almost without surprise this time, all things
restored to the places they had occupied at the
critical moment when I had first noticed the
fallen packing-case.</p>
<p>Instantly I stepped out into the street, picked
up the box, and replaced it in the cart: in the
next moment the bicycle had spun round the
corner, passed the cart without let or hindrance,
and soon vanished in the distance, in a cloud
of dust.</p>
<p>“Delightful power of magic!” I thought.
“How much of human suffering I have—not
only relieved, but actually annihilated!” And,
in a glow of conscious virtue, I stood watching
the unloading of the cart, still holding the
Magic Watch open in my hand, as I was
curious to see what would happen when we
again reached the exact time at which I had
put back the hand.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_349">349</div>
<p>The result was one that, if only I had considered
the thing carefully, I might have
foreseen: as the hand of the Watch touched
the mark, the spring-cart—which had driven
off, and was by this time half-way down the
street, was back again at the door, and in the
act of starting, while—oh woe for the golden
dream of world-wide benevolence that had
dazzled my dreaming fancy!—the wounded
youth was once more reclining on the heap of
pillows, his pale face set rigidly in the hard
lines that told of pain resolutely endured.</p>
<p>“Oh mocking Magic Watch!” I said to myself,
as I passed out of the little town, and took
the seaward road that led to my lodgings.
“The good I fancied I could do is vanished
like a dream: the evil of this troublesome
world is the only abiding reality!”</p>
<p>And now I must record an experience so
strange, that I think it only fair, before beginning
to relate it, to release my much-enduring
reader from any obligation he may feel to believe
this part of my story. <i>I</i> would not have
believed it, I freely confess, if I had not seen it
with my own eyes: then why should I expect
<span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
it of my reader, who, quite possibly, has never
seen anything of the sort?</p>
<p>I was passing a pretty little villa, which
stood rather back from the road, in its own
grounds, with bright flower-beds in front—creepers
wandering over the walls and hanging
in festoons about the bow-windows—an easy-chair
forgotten on the lawn, with a newspaper
lying near it—a small pug-dog “couchant”
before it, resolved to guard the treasure even
at the sacrifice of life—and a front-door
standing invitingly half-open. “Here is my
chance,” I thought, “for testing the reverse
action of the Magic Watch!” I pressed the
‘reversal-peg’ and walked in. In <i>another</i>
house, the entrance of a stranger might cause
surprise—perhaps anger, even going so far
as to expel the said stranger with violence:
but <i>here</i>, I knew, nothing of the sort could
happen. The <i>ordinary</i> course of events—first,
to think nothing about me; then, hearing my
footsteps to look up and see me; and then to
wonder what business I had there—would be
reversed by the action of my Watch. They
would <i>first</i> wonder who I was, <i>then</i> see me,
<span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
then look down, and think no more about me.
And as to being expelled with violence, <i>that</i>
event would necessarily come <i>first</i> in this case.
“So, if I can once get <i>in</i>,” I said to myself,
“all risk of <i>expulsion</i> will be over!”</p>
<div class="img" id="fig43">
<img src="images/i351.jpg" alt="‘THE PUG-DOG SAT UP’" width="500" height="449" />
<p class="center small">‘THE PUG-DOG SAT UP’</p>
</div>
<p>The pug-dog sat up, as a precautionary
measure, as I passed; but, as I took no notice
of the treasure he was guarding, he let me go
by without even one remonstrant bark. “He
that takes my life,” he seemed to be saying,
wheezily, to himself, “takes trash: But he that
takes the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>——!” But this
awful contingency I did not face.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_352">352</div>
<p>The party in the drawing-room—I had
walked straight in, you understand, without
ringing the bell, or giving any notice of my
approach—consisted of four laughing rosy
children, of ages from about fourteen down to
ten, who were, apparently, all coming towards
the door (I found they were really walking
<i>backwards</i>), while their mother, seated by the
fire with some needlework on her lap, was saying,
just as I entered the room, “Now, girls,
you may get your things on for a walk.”</p>
<p>To my utter astonishment—for I was not
yet accustomed to the action of the Watch—“all
smiles ceased” (as Browning says) on
the four pretty faces, and they all got out
pieces of needle-work, and sat down. No one
noticed <i>me</i> in the least, as I quietly took a
chair and sat down to watch them.</p>
<p>When the needle-work had been unfolded,
and they were all ready to begin, their mother
said “Come, <i>that’s</i> done, at last! You may fold
up your work, girls.” But the children took
no notice whatever of the remark; on the contrary,
they set to work at once sewing—if that
is the proper word to describe an operation
<span class="pb" id="Page_353">353</span>
such as <i>I</i> had never before witnessed. Each
of them threaded her needle with a short end
of thread attached to the work, which was instantly
pulled by an invisible force through the
stuff, dragging the needle after it: the nimble
fingers of the little sempstress caught it at
the other side, but only to lose it again the
next moment. And so the work went on,
steadily undoing itself, and the neatly-stitched
little dresses, or whatever they were, steadily
falling to pieces. Now and then one of the
children would pause, as the recovered thread
became inconveniently long, wind it on a bobbin,
and start again with another short end.</p>
<p>At last all the work was picked to pieces
and put away, and the lady led the way into
the next room, walking backwards, and making
the insane remark “Not yet, dear: we <i>must</i>
get the sewing done first.” After which, I
was not surprised to see the children skipping
backwards after her, exclaiming “Oh, mother,
it <i>is</i> such a lovely day for a walk!”</p>
<p>In the dining-room, the table had only dirty
plates and empty dishes on it. However the
party—with the addition of a gentleman, as
<span class="pb" id="Page_354">354</span>
good-natured, and as rosy, as the children—seated
themselves at it very contentedly.</p>
<p>You have seen people eating cherry-tart, and
every now and then cautiously conveying a
cherry-stone from their lips to their plates?
Well, something like that went on all through
this ghastly—or shall we say ‘ghostly’?—banquet.
An empty fork is raised to the
lips: there it receives a neatly-cut piece of
mutton, and swiftly conveys it to the plate,
where it instantly attaches itself to the mutton
already there. Soon one of the plates, furnished
with a complete slice of mutton and two
potatoes, was handed up to the presiding gentleman,
who quietly replaced the slice on the
joint, and the potatoes in the dish.</p>
<p>Their conversation was, if possible, more
bewildering than their mode of dining. It
began by the youngest girl suddenly, and without
provocation, addressing her eldest sister.
“Oh, you <i>wicked</i> story-teller!” she said.</p>
<p>I expected a sharp reply from the sister;
but, instead of this, she turned laughingly to
her father, and said, in a very loud stage-whisper,
“To be a bride!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_355">355</div>
<p>The father, in order to do <i>his</i> part in a
conversation that seemed only fit for lunatics,
replied “Whisper it to me, dear.”</p>
<p>But she <i>didn’t</i> whisper (these children never
did anything they were told): she said, quite
loud, “Of course not! Everybody knows what
<i>Dolly</i> wants!”</p>
<p>And little Dolly shrugged her shoulders, and
said, with a pretty pettishness, “Now, Father,
you’re not to tease! You know I don’t want to
be bride’s-maid to <i>anybody</i>!”</p>
<p>“And Dolly’s to be the fourth,” was her
father’s idiotic reply.</p>
<p>Here Number Three put in her oar. “Oh,
it <i>is</i> settled, Mother dear, really and truly!
Mary told us all about it. It’s to be next
Tuesday four weeks—and three of her cousins
are coming to be bride’s-maids—and——”</p>
<p>“<i>She</i> doesn’t forget it, Minnie!” the Mother
laughingly replied. “I do wish they’d get it
settled! I don’t like long engagements.”</p>
<p>And Minnie wound up the conversation—if
so chaotic a series of remarks deserves the
name—with “Only think! We passed the
Cedars this morning, just exactly as Mary
<span class="pb" id="Page_356">356</span>
Davenant was standing at the gate, wishing
good-bye to Mister—I forget his name. Of
course we looked the other way.”</p>
<p>By this time I was so hopelessly confused
that I gave up listening, and followed the
dinner down into the kitchen.</p>
<p>But to you, O hypercritical reader, resolute
to believe no item of this weird adventure, what
need to tell how the mutton was placed on the
spit, and slowly unroasted—how the potatoes
were wrapped in their skins, and handed over
to the gardener to be buried—how, when the
mutton had at length attained to rawness, the
fire, which had gradually changed from red-heat
to a mere blaze, died down so suddenly
that the cook had only just time to catch its
last flicker on the end of a match—or how the
maid, having taken the mutton off the spit,
carried it (backwards, of course) out of the
house, to meet the butcher, who was coming
(also backwards) down the road?</p>
<p>The longer I thought over this strange
adventure, the more hopelessly tangled the
mystery became: and it was a real relief to
meet Arthur in the road, and get him to go
<span class="pb" id="Page_357">357</span>
with me up to the Hall, to learn what news
the telegraph had brought. I told him, as we
went, what had happened at the Station, but
as to my further adventures I thought it best,
for the present, to say nothing.</p>
<p>The Earl was sitting alone when we entered.
“I am glad you are come in to keep me company,”
he said. “Muriel is gone to bed—the
excitement of that terrible scene was too much
for her—and Eric has gone to the hotel to
pack his things, to start for London by the
early train.”</p>
<p>“Then the telegram has come?” I said.</p>
<p>“Did you not hear? Oh, I had forgotten:
it came in after you left the Station. Yes, it’s
all right: Eric has got his commission; and,
now that he has arranged matters with Muriel,
he has business in town that must be seen to
at once.”</p>
<p>“What arrangement do you mean?” I asked
with a sinking heart, as the thought of Arthur’s
crushed hopes came to my mind. “Do you
mean that they are <i>engaged</i>?”</p>
<p>“They have been engaged—in a sense—for
two years,” the old man gently replied:
<span class="pb" id="Page_358">358</span>
“that is, he has had my promise to consent
to it, so soon as he could secure a permanent
and settled line in life. I could never be happy
with my child married to a man without an
object to live for—without even an object to
die for!”</p>
<p>“I hope they will be happy,” a strange voice
said. The speaker was evidently in the room,
but I had not heard the door open, and I
looked round in some astonishment. The Earl
seemed to share my surprise. “Who spoke?”
he exclaimed.</p>
<p>“It was I,” said Arthur, looking at us with
a worn, haggard face, and eyes from which the
light of life seemed suddenly to have faded.
“And let me wish <i>you</i> joy also, dear friend,”
he added, looking sadly at the Earl, and speaking
in the same hollow tones that had startled
us so much.</p>
<p>“Thank you,” the old man said, simply and
heartily.</p>
<p>A silence followed: then I rose, feeling sure
that Arthur would wish to be alone, and bade
our gentle host ‘Good night’: Arthur took his
hand, but said nothing: nor did he speak again,
<span class="pb" id="Page_359">359</span>
as we went home, till we were in the house
and had lit our bed-room candles. Then he
said, more to himself than to me, “<i>The heart
knoweth its own bitterness</i>. I never understood
those words till now.”</p>
<p>The next few days passed wearily enough.
I felt no inclination to call again, by myself,
at the Hall; still less to propose that Arthur
should go with me: it seemed better to wait
till Time—that gentle healer of our bitterest
sorrows—should have helped him to recover
from the first shock of the disappointment
that had blighted his life.</p>
<p>Business, however, soon demanded my presence
in town; and I had to announce to
Arthur that I must leave him for a while.
“But I hope to run down again in a month,”
I added. “I would stay now, if I could. I
don’t think it’s good for you to be alone.”</p>
<p>“No, I ca’n’t face solitude, <i>here</i>, for long,”
said Arthur. “But don’t think about <i>me</i>. I
have made up my mind to accept a post in
India, that has been offered me. Out there,
I suppose I shall find something to live for; I
can’t see <i>anything</i> at present. ‘<i>This life of
<span class="pb" id="Page_360">360</span>
mine I guard, as God’s high gift, from scathe
and wrong, Not greatly care to lose!</i>’”</p>
<p>“Yes,” I said: “your name-sake bore as
heavy a blow, and lived through it.”</p>
<p>“A far heavier one than <i>mine</i>,” said Arthur.
“The woman <i>he</i> loved proved false. There
is no such cloud as <i>that</i> on my memory of—of——”
He left the name unuttered, and
went on hurriedly. “But <i>you</i> will return, will
you not?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I shall come back for a short time.”</p>
<p>“Do,” said Arthur: “and you shall write
and tell me of our friends. I’ll send you my
address when I’m settled down.”</p>

<h2 id="c24">CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><span class="small">THE FROGS’ BIRTHDAY-TREAT.</span></h2>
<p>And so it came to pass that, just a week
after the day when my Fairy-friends first appeared
as Children, I found myself taking a
farewell-stroll through the wood, in the hope
of meeting them once more. I had but to
stretch myself on the smooth turf, and the
‘eerie’ feeling was on me in a moment.</p>
<p>“Put oor ear <i>welly</i> low down,” said Bruno,
“and I’ll tell oo a secret! It’s the Frogs’
Birthday-Treat—and we’ve lost the Baby!”</p>
<p>“<i>What</i> Baby?” I said, quite bewildered by
this complicated piece of news.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_362">362</div>
<p>“The <i>Queen’s</i> Baby, a course!” said Bruno.
“Titania’s Baby. And we’s <i>welly</i> sorry.
Sylvie, she’s—oh so sorry!”</p>
<p>“<i>How</i> sorry is she?” I asked, mischievously.</p>
<p>“Three-quarters of a yard,” Bruno replied
with perfect solemnity. “And <i>I’m</i> a little
sorry too,” he added, shutting his eyes so as
not to see that he was smiling.</p>
<p>“And what are you doing about the Baby?”</p>
<p>“Well, the <i>soldiers</i> are all looking for it—up
and down—everywhere.”</p>
<p>“The <i>soldiers</i>?” I exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Yes, a course!” said Bruno. “When
there’s no fighting to be done, the soldiers
doos any little odd jobs, oo know.”</p>
<p>I was amused at the idea of its being a
‘little odd job’ to find the Royal Baby. “But
how did you come to lose it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“We put it in a flower,” Sylvie, who had
just joined us, explained with her eyes full of
tears. “Only we ca’n’t remember <i>which</i>!”</p>
<p>“She says <i>us</i> put it in a flower,” Bruno
interrupted, “’cause she doosn’t want <i>I</i> to get
punished. But it were really <i>me</i> what put it
there. <i>Sylvie</i> were picking Dindledums.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_363">363</div>
<div class="img" id="fig44">
<img src="images/i363.jpg" alt="THE QUEEN’S BABY" width="500" height="765" />
<p class="center small">THE QUEEN’S BABY</p>
</div>
<p>“You shouldn’t
say ‘<i>us</i> put it in
a flower’,” Sylvie very
gravely remarked.</p>
<p>“Well, <i>hus</i>, then,” said
Bruno. “I never <i>can</i> remember
those horrid H’s!”</p>
<p>“Let me help you to look
for it,” I said. So Sylvie
and I made a ‘voyage of
discovery’ among all the
flowers; but there was no
Baby to be seen.</p>
<p>“What’s become of
Bruno?” I said, when we
had completed our tour.</p>
<p>“He’s down in the ditch
there,” said Sylvie, “amusing
a young Frog.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_364">364</div>
<p>I went down on my hands and knees to look
for him, for I felt very curious to know how
young Frogs <i>ought</i> to be amused. After a
minute’s search, I found him sitting at the edge
of the ditch, by the side of the little Frog, and
looking rather disconsolate.</p>
<p>“How are you getting on, Bruno?” I said,
nodding to him as he looked up.</p>
<p>“Ca’n’t amuse it no more,” Bruno answered,
very dolefully, “’cause it won’t say what it
would like to do next! I’ve showed it all
the duck-weeds—and a live caddis-worm—but
it won’t say nuffin! What—would oo—like?”
he shouted into the ear of the Frog:
but the little creature sat quite still, and took
no notice of him. “It’s deaf, I think!” Bruno
said, turning away with a sigh. “And it’s time
to get the Theatre ready.”</p>
<p>“Who are the audience to be?”</p>
<p>“Only but Frogs,” said Bruno. “But they
haven’t comed yet. They wants to be drove
up, like sheep.”</p>
<p>“Would it save time,” I suggested, “if <i>I</i>
were to walk round with Sylvie, to drive up the
Frogs, while <i>you</i> get the Theatre ready?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_365">365</div>
<p>“That <i>are</i> a good plan!” cried Bruno. “But
where <i>are</i> Sylvie?”</p>
<p>“I’m here!” said Sylvie, peeping over the
edge of the bank. “I was just watching two
Frogs that were having a race.”</p>
<p>“Which won it?” Bruno eagerly inquired.</p>
<p>Sylvie was puzzled. “He <i>does</i> ask such hard
questions!” she confided to me.</p>
<p>“And what’s to happen in the Theatre?”
I asked.</p>
<p>“First they have their Birthday-Feast,”
Sylvie said: “then Bruno does some Bits of
Shakespeare; then he tells them a Story.”</p>
<p>“I should think the Frogs like the Feast
best. Don’t they?”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s generally very few of them
that get any. They <i>will</i> keep their mouths
shut so tight! And it’s just as well they <i>do</i>,”
she added, “because Bruno likes to cook it
himself: and he cooks <i>very</i> queerly. Now
they’re all in. Would you just help me to
put them with their heads the right way?”</p>
<p>We soon managed this part of the business,
though the Frogs kept up a most discontented
croaking all the time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_366">366</div>
<p>“What <i>are</i> they saying?” I asked Sylvie.</p>
<p>“They’re saying ‘Fork! Fork!’ It’s very
silly of them! You’re not going to <i>have</i>
forks!” she announced with some severity.
“Those that want any Feast have just got
to open their mouths, and Bruno’ll put some
of it in!”</p>
<p>At this moment Bruno appeared, wearing a
little white apron to show that he was a Cook,
and carrying a tureen full of very queer-looking
soup. I watched very carefully as he moved
about among the Frogs; but I could not see
that <i>any</i> of them opened their mouths to be fed—except
one very young one, and I’m nearly
sure it did it accidentally, in yawning. However
Bruno instantly put a large spoonful of
soup into its mouth, and the poor little thing
coughed violently for some time.</p>
<p>So Sylvie and I had to share the soup
between us, and to <i>pretend</i> to enjoy it, for it
certainly was <i>very</i> queerly cooked.</p>
<p>I only ventured to take <i>one</i> spoonful of it
(“Sylvie’s Summer-Soup,” Bruno said it was),
and must candidly confess that it was not <i>at
all</i> nice; and I could not feel surprised that
<span class="pb" id="Page_367">367</span>
so many of the guests had kept their mouths
shut up tight.</p>
<p>“What’s the soup <i>made</i> of, Bruno?” said
Sylvie, who had put a spoonful of it to her lips,
and was making a wry face over it.</p>
<p>And Bruno’s answer was anything but encouraging.
“Bits of things!”</p>
<p>The entertainment was to conclude with
“Bits of Shakespeare,” as Sylvie expressed
it, which were all to be done by Bruno, Sylvie
being fully engaged in making the Frogs keep
their heads towards the stage: after which
Bruno was to appear in his real character, and
tell them a Story of his own invention.</p>
<p>“Will the Story have a Moral to it?” I
asked Sylvie, while Bruno was away behind
the hedge, dressing for the first ‘Bit.’</p>
<p>“I <i>think</i> so,” Sylvie replied doubtfully.
“There generally <i>is</i> a Moral, only he puts it
in too soon.”</p>
<p>“And will he <i>say</i> all the Bits of Shakespeare?”</p>
<p>“No, he’ll only <i>act</i> them,” said Sylvie. “He
knows hardly any of the words. When I see
what he’s dressed like, I’ve to tell the Frogs
<span class="pb" id="Page_368">368</span>
what character it is. They’re always in such
a hurry to guess! Don’t you hear them all
saying ‘What? What?’” And so indeed they
were: it had only sounded like croaking, till
Sylvie explained it, but I could now make
out the “Wawt? Wawt?” quite distinctly.</p>
<p>“But why do they try to guess it before they
see it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Sylvie said: “but they
always <i>do</i>. Sometimes they begin guessing
weeks and weeks before the day!”</p>
<p>(So now, when you hear the Frogs croaking
in a particularly melancholy way, you may
be sure they’re trying to guess Bruno’s next
Shakespeare ‘Bit’. Isn’t <i>that</i> interesting?)</p>
<p>However, the chorus of guessing was cut
short by Bruno, who suddenly rushed on from
behind the scenes, and took a flying leap down
among the Frogs, to re-arrange them.</p>
<p>For the oldest and fattest Frog—who had
never been properly arranged so that he could
see the stage, and so had no idea what was
going on—was getting restless, and had upset
several of the Frogs, and turned others round
with their heads the wrong way. And it was
<span class="pb" id="Page_369">369</span>
no good at all, Bruno said, to do a ‘Bit’ of
Shakespeare when there was nobody to look
at it (you see he didn’t count <i>me</i> as anybody).
So he set to work with a stick, stirring them
up, very much as you would stir up tea in a
cup, till most of them had at least <i>one</i> great
stupid eye gazing at the stage.</p>
<p>“<i>Oo</i> must come and sit among them, Sylvie,”
he said in despair, “I’ve put these two side-by-side,
with their noses the same way, ever so
many times, but they <i>do</i> squarrel so!”</p>
<p>So Sylvie took her place as ‘Mistress of the
Ceremonies,’ and Bruno vanished again behind
the scenes, to dress for the first ‘Bit.’</p>
<p>“Hamlet!” was suddenly proclaimed, in the
clear sweet tones I knew so well. The croaking
all ceased in a moment, and I turned to
the stage, in some curiosity to see what Bruno’s
ideas were as to the behaviour of Shakespeare’s
greatest Character.</p>
<p>According to this eminent interpreter of the
Drama, Hamlet wore a short black cloak
(which he chiefly used for muffling up his face,
as if he suffered a good deal from toothache),
and turned out his toes very much as he
<span class="pb" id="Page_370">370</span>
walked. “To be or not to be!” Hamlet
remarked in a cheerful tone, and then turned
head-over-heels several times, his cloak dropping
off in the performance.</p>
<p>I felt a little disappointed: Bruno’s conception
of the part seemed so wanting in
dignity. “Won’t he say any more of the
speech?” I whispered to Sylvie.</p>
<p>“I <i>think</i> not,” Sylvie whispered in reply.
“He generally turns head-over-heels when he
doesn’t know any more words.”</p>
<p>Bruno had meanwhile settled the question
by disappearing from the stage; and the Frogs
instantly began inquiring the name of the
next Character.</p>
<p>“You’ll know directly!” cried Sylvie, as she
adjusted two or three young Frogs that had
struggled round with their backs to the
stage. “Macbeth!” she added, as Bruno
re-appeared.</p>
<p>Macbeth had something twisted round him,
that went over one shoulder and under the
other arm, and was meant, I believe, for a
Scotch plaid. He had a thorn in his hand,
which he held out at arm’s length, as if he
<span class="pb" id="Page_371">371</span>
were a little afraid of it. “Is this a <i>dagger</i>?”
Macbeth inquired, in a puzzled sort of tone:
and instantly a chorus of “Thorn! Thorn!”
arose from the Frogs (I had quite learned to
understand their croaking by this time).</p>
<p>“It’s a <i>dagger</i>!” Sylvie proclaimed in a
peremptory tone. “Hold your tongues!” And
the croaking ceased at once.</p>
<p>Shakespeare has not told us, so far as I
know, that Macbeth had any such eccentric
habit as turning head-over-heels in private
life: but Bruno evidently considered it quite
an essential part of the character, and left the
stage in a series of somersaults. However,
he was back again in a few moments, having
tucked under his chin the end of a tuft of
wool (probably left on the thorn by a wandering
sheep), which made a magnificent beard,
that reached nearly down to his feet.</p>
<p>“Shylock!” Sylvie proclaimed. “No, I beg
your pardon!” she hastily corrected herself,
“King Lear! I hadn’t noticed the crown.”
(Bruno had very cleverly provided one, which
fitted him exactly, by cutting out the centre
of a dandelion to make room for his head.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_372">372</div>
<p>King Lear folded his arms (to the imminent
peril of his beard) and said, in a mild explanatory
tone, “Ay, every <i>inch</i> a king!” and then
paused, as if to consider how this could best be
proved. And here, with all possible deference
to Bruno as a Shakespearian critic, I <i>must</i>
express my opinion that the poet did <i>not</i> mean
his three great tragic heroes to be so strangely
alike in their personal habits; nor do I believe
that he would have accepted the faculty of
turning head-over-heels as any proof at all of
royal descent. Yet it appeared that King
Lear, after deep meditation, could think of no
other argument by which to prove his kingship:
and, as this was the last of the ‘Bits’ of
Shakespeare (“We never do more than <i>three</i>,”
Sylvie explained in a whisper), Bruno gave the
audience quite a long series of somersaults
before he finally retired, leaving the enraptured
Frogs all crying out “More! More!” which I
suppose was their way of encoring a performance.
But Bruno wouldn’t appear again, till
the proper time came for telling the Story.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_373">373</div>

<p class="center small">THE FROGS’ BIRTHDAY-TREAT</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_374">374</div>
<p>When he appeared at last in his <i>real</i> character,
I noticed a remarkable change in his behaviour.
He tried no more somersaults. It was clearly
his opinion that, however suitable the habit of
turning head-over-heels might be to such petty
individuals as Hamlet and King Lear, it would
never do for <i>Bruno</i> to sacrifice his dignity to
such an extent. But it was equally clear that
he did not feel entirely at his ease, standing all
alone on the stage, with no costume to disguise
him: and though he began, several times,
“There were a Mouse—,” he kept glancing
up and down, and on all sides, as if in search of
more comfortable quarters from which to tell
the Story. Standing on one side of the stage,
and partly overshadowing it, was a tall fox-glove,
which seemed, as the evening breeze
gently swayed it hither and thither, to offer
exactly the sort of accommodation that the
orator desired. Having once decided on his
quarters, it needed only a second or two for
him to run up the stem like a tiny squirrel, and
to seat himself astride on the topmost bend,
where the fairy-bells clustered most closely,
and from whence he could look down on his
audience from such a height that all shyness
vanished, and he began his Story merrily.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_375">375</div>
<p>“Once there were a Mouse and a Crocodile
and a Man and a Goat and a Lion.” I had
never heard the ‘dramatis personæ’ tumbled
into a story with such profusion and in such
reckless haste; and it fairly took my breath
away. Even Sylvie gave a little gasp, and
allowed three of the Frogs, who seemed to be
getting tired of the entertainment, to hop
away into the ditch, without attempting to
stop them.</p>
<p>“And the Mouse found a Shoe, and it thought
it were a Mouse-trap. So it got right in, and it
stayed in ever so long.”</p>
<p>“Why did it <i>stay</i> in?” said Sylvie. Her
function seemed to be much the same as that
of the Chorus in a Greek Play: she had to
encourage the orator, and draw him out, by a
series of intelligent questions.</p>
<p>“’Cause it thought it couldn’t get out again,”
Bruno explained. “It were a clever mouse.
It knew it couldn’t get out of traps!”</p>
<p>“But why did it go in at all?” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“—and it jamp, and it jamp,” Bruno proceeded,
ignoring this question, “and at last it
got right out again. And it looked at the mark
<span class="pb" id="Page_376">376</span>
in the Shoe. And the Man’s name were in it.
So it knew it wasn’t its own Shoe.”</p>
<p>“Had it thought it <i>was</i>?” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“Why, didn’t I tell oo it thought it were a
<i>Mouse-trap</i>?” the indignant orator replied.
“Please, Mister Sir, will oo make Sylvie attend?”
Sylvie was silenced, and was all attention:
in fact, she and I were most of the audience
now, as the Frogs kept hopping away,
and there were very few of them left.</p>
<p>“So the Mouse gave the Man his Shoe.
And the Man were welly glad, ’cause he hadn’t
got but one Shoe, and he were hopping to get
the other.”</p>
<p>Here I ventured on a question. “Do you
mean ‘hopping,’ or ‘hoping’?”</p>
<p>“Bofe,” said Bruno. “And the Man took
the Goat out of the Sack.” (“We haven’t heard
of the <i>sack</i> before,” I said. “Nor you won’t
hear of it again,” said Bruno). “And he said
to the Goat, ‘Oo will walk about here till I
comes back.’ And he went and he tumbled
into a deep hole. And the Goat walked round
and round. And it walked under the Tree.
And it wug its tail. And it looked up in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_377">377</span>
Tree. And it sang a sad little Song. Oo
never heard such a sad little Song!”</p>
<p>“Can you sing it, Bruno?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Iss, I can,” Bruno readily replied. “And
I sa’n’t. It would make Sylvie cry——”</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t!” Sylvie interrupted in great
indignation. “And I don’t believe the Goat
sang it at all!”</p>
<p>“It did, though!” said Bruno. “It singed
it right froo. I <i>sawed</i> it singing with its
long beard——”</p>
<p>“It couldn’t sing with its <i>beard</i>,” I said,
hoping to puzzle the little fellow: “a beard
isn’t a <i>voice</i>.”</p>
<p>“Well then, <i>oo</i> couldn’t walk with Sylvie!”
Bruno cried triumphantly. “Sylvie isn’t a
<i>foot</i>!”</p>
<p>I thought I had better follow Sylvie’s example,
and be silent for a while. Bruno was
too sharp for us.</p>
<p>“And when it had singed all the Song, it
ran away—for to get along to look for the
Man, oo know. And the Crocodile got along
after it—for to bite it, oo know. And the
Mouse got along after the Crocodile.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_378">378</div>
<p>“Wasn’t the Crocodile <i>running</i>?” Sylvie
enquired. She appealed to me. “Crocodiles
do run, don’t they?”</p>
<p>I suggested “crawling” as the proper word.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t running,” said Bruno, “and he
wasn’t crawling. He went struggling along like
a portmanteau. And he held his chin ever so
high in the air——”</p>
<p>“What did he do <i>that</i> for?” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“’Cause he hadn’t got a toofache!” said
Bruno. “Ca’n’t oo make out <i>nuffin</i> wizout I
’splain it? Why, if he’d had a toofache, a
course he’d have held his head down—like
this—and he’d have put a lot of warm
blankets round it!”</p>
<p>“If he’d <i>had</i> any blankets,” Sylvie argued.</p>
<p>“Course he <i>had</i> blankets!” retorted her
brother. “Doos oo think Crocodiles goes
walks wizout blankets? And he frowned with
his eyebrows. And the Goat was welly
flightened at his eyebrows!”</p>
<p>“I’d never be afraid of <i>eyebrows</i>!” exclaimed
Sylvie.</p>
<p>“I should think oo <i>would</i>, though, if they’d
got a Crocodile fastened to them, like these
<span class="pb" id="Page_379">379</span>
had! And so the Man jamp, and he jamp,
and at last he got right out of the hole.”</p>
<p>Sylvie gave another little gasp: this rapid
dodging about among the characters of the
Story had taken away her breath.</p>
<p>“And he runned away—for to look for the
Goat, oo know. And he heard the Lion
grunting——”</p>
<p>“Lions don’t grunt,” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“This one did,” said Bruno. “And its
mouth were like a large cupboard. And it had
plenty of room in its mouth. And the Lion
runned after the Man—for to eat him, oo know.
And the Mouse runned after the Lion.”</p>
<p>“But the Mouse was running after the
<i>Crocodile</i>,” I said: “he couldn’t run after
<i>both</i>!”</p>
<p>Bruno sighed over the density of his audience,
but explained very patiently. “He <i>did</i>
runned after <i>bofe</i>: ’cause they went the same
way! And first he caught the Crocodile, and
then he didn’t catch the Lion. And when he’d
caught the Crocodile, what doos oo think he did—’cause
he’d got pincers in his pocket?”</p>
<p>“I ca’n’t guess,” said Sylvie.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_380">380</div>
<div class="img" id="fig46">
<img src="images/i380.jpg" alt="‘HE WRENCHED OUT THAT CROCODILE’S TOOF!’" width="500" height="486" />
<p class="center small">‘HE WRENCHED OUT THAT CROCODILE’S TOOF!’</p>
</div>
<p>“Nobody couldn’t guess it!” Bruno cried in
high glee. “Why, he wrenched out that
Crocodile’s toof!”</p>
<p>“<i>Which</i> tooth?” I ventured to ask.</p>
<p>But Bruno was not to be puzzled. “The
toof he were going to bite the Goat with, a
course!”</p>
<p>“He couldn’t be sure about that,” I argued,
“unless he wrenched out <i>all</i> its teeth.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_381">381</div>
<p>Bruno laughed merrily, and half sang, as he
swung himself backwards and forwards, “He
did—wrenched—out—<i>all</i> its teef!”</p>
<p>“Why did the Crocodile wait to have them
wrenched out?” said Sylvie.</p>
<p>“It had to wait,” said Bruno.</p>
<p>I ventured on another question. “But what
became of the Man who said ‘You may wait
here till I come back’?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t say ‘Oo <i>may</i>,’” Bruno explained.
“He said, ‘Oo <i>will</i>.’ Just like Sylvie says to
me ‘Oo will do oor lessons till twelve o’clock.’
Oh, I <i>wiss</i>,” he added with a little sigh,
“I <i>wiss</i> Sylvie would say ‘Oo <i>may</i> do oor
lessons’!”</p>
<p>This was a dangerous subject for discussion,
Sylvie seemed to think. She returned to the
Story. “But what became of the Man?”</p>
<p>“Well, the Lion springed at him. But it
came so slow, it were three weeks in the
air——”</p>
<p>“Did the Man wait for it all that time?”
I said.</p>
<p>“Course he didn’t!” Bruno replied, gliding
head-first down the stem of the fox-glove, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_382">382</span>
the Story was evidently close to its end. “He
sold his house, and he packed up his things,
while the Lion were coming. And he went
and he lived in another town. So the Lion ate
the wrong man.”</p>
<p>This was evidently the Moral: so Sylvie
made her final proclamation to the Frogs.
“The Story’s finished! And whatever is to be
<i>learned</i> from it,” she added, aside to me, “I’m
sure <i>I</i> don’t know!”</p>
<p>I did not feel <i>quite</i> clear about it myself, so
made no suggestion: but the Frogs seemed
quite content, Moral or no Moral, and merely
raised a husky chorus of “Off! Off!” as they
hopped away.</p>

<br /><span class="small">LOOKING EASTWARD.</span></h2>
<p>“It’s just a week,” I said, three days later,
to Arthur, “since we heard of Lady Muriel’s
engagement. I think <i>I</i> ought to call, at any
rate, and offer my congratulations. Won’t
you come with me?”</p>
<p>A pained expression passed over his face.
“When must you leave us?” he asked.</p>
<p>“By the first train on Monday.”</p>
<p>“Well—yes, I <i>will</i> come with you. It
would seem strange and unfriendly if I didn’t.
But this is only Friday. Give me till Sunday
afternoon. I shall be stronger then.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_384">384</div>
<p>Shading his eyes with one hand, as if half-ashamed
of the tears that were coursing down
his cheeks, he held the other out to me. It
trembled as I clasped it.</p>
<p>I tried to frame some words of sympathy;
but they seemed poor and cold, and I left them
unspoken. “Good night!” was all I said.</p>
<p>“Good night, dear friend!” he replied.
There was a manly vigour in his tone that
convinced me he was wrestling with, and
triumphing over, the great sorrow that had
so nearly wrecked his life—and that, on the
stepping-stone of his dead self, he would
surely rise to higher things!</p>
<p>There was no chance, I was glad to think,
as we set out on Sunday afternoon, of meeting
<i>Eric</i> at the Hall, as he had returned to town
the day after his engagement was announced.
<i>His</i> presence might have disturbed the calm—the
almost unnatural calm—with which Arthur
met the woman who had won his heart, and
murmured the few graceful words of sympathy
that the occasion demanded.</p>
<p>Lady Muriel was perfectly radiant with
happiness: sadness could not live in the light
<span class="pb" id="Page_385">385</span>
of such a smile: and even Arthur brightened
under it, and, when she remarked “You see
I’m watering my flowers, though it <i>is</i> the
Sabbath-Day,” his voice had almost its old ring
of cheerfulness as he replied “Even on the
Sabbath-Day works of mercy are allowed.
But this <i>isn’t</i> the Sabbath-Day. The Sabbath-Day
has ceased to exist.”</p>
<p>“I know it’s not <i>Saturday</i>,” Lady Muriel
replied: “but isn’t Sunday often called ‘the
Christian Sabbath’?”</p>
<p>“It is so called, I think, in recognition of
the <i>spirit</i> of the Jewish institution, that one day
in seven should be a day of <i>rest</i>. But I hold
that Christians are freed from the <i>literal</i> observance
of the Fourth Commandment.”</p>
<p>“Then where is our <i>authority</i> for Sunday
observance?”</p>
<p>“We have, first, the fact that the seventh
day was ‘sanctified’, when God rested from the
work of Creation. That is binding on us as
<i>Theists</i>. Secondly, we have the fact that ‘the
Lord’s Day’ is a <i>Christian</i> institution. That
is binding on us as <i>Christians</i>.”</p>
<p>“And your practical rules would be——?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_386">386</div>
<p>“First, as Theists, to keep it <i>holy</i> in some
special way, and to make it, so far as is
reasonably possible, a day of <i>rest</i>. Secondly,
as <i>Christians</i>, to attend public worship.”</p>
<p>“And what of <i>amusements</i>?”</p>
<p>“I would say of them, as of all kinds of
<i>work</i>, whatever is innocent on a week-day, is
innocent on Sunday, provided it does not interfere
with the duties of the day.”</p>
<p>“Then you would allow children to <i>play</i> on
Sunday?”</p>
<p>“Certainly I should. Why make the day
irksome to their restless natures?”</p>
<p>“I have a letter somewhere,” said Lady
Muriel, “from an old friend, describing the way
in which Sunday was kept in her younger days.
I will fetch it for you.”</p>
<p>“I had a similar description, <i>vivâ voce</i>, years
ago,” Arthur said when she had left us, “from
a little girl. It was really touching to hear the
melancholy tone in which she said ‘On Sunday
I mustn’t play with my doll! On Sunday I
mustn’t run on the sands! On Sunday I mustn’t
dig in the garden!’ Poor child! She had indeed
abundant cause for hating Sunday!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_387">387</div>
<p>“Here is the letter,” said Lady Muriel, returning.
“Let me read you a piece of it.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“<i>When, as a child, I first opened my eyes
on a Sunday-morning, a feeling of dismal anticipation,
which began at least on the Friday,
culminated. I knew what was before me, and
my wish, if not my word, was ‘Would God
it were evening!’ It was no day of rest,
but a day of texts, of catechisms (Watts’), of
tracts about converted swearers, godly char-women,
and edifying deaths of sinners saved.</i></p>
<p>“<i>Up with the lark, hymns and portions of
Scripture had to be learned by heart till 8
o’clock, when there were family-prayers, then
breakfast, which I was never able to enjoy, partly
from the fast already undergone, and partly
from the outlook I dreaded.</i></p>
<p>“<i>At 9 came Sunday-School; and it made
me indignant to be put into the class with the
village-children, as well as alarmed lest, by some
mistake of mine, I should be put below them.</i></p>
<p>“<i>The Church-Service was a veritable Wilderness
of Zin. I wandered in it, pitching the
tabernacle of my thoughts on the lining of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_388">388</span>
square family-pew, the fidgets of my small
brothers, and the horror of knowing that, on
the Monday, I should have to write out, from
memory, jottings of the rambling disconnected
extempore sermon, which might have had any
text but its own, and to stand or fall by the
result.</i></p>
<p>“<i>This was followed by a cold dinner at 1</i>
(<i>servants to have</i> no <i>work</i>), <i>Sunday-School again
from 2 to 4, and Evening-Service at 6. The
intervals were perhaps the greatest trial of all,
from the efforts I had to make, to be less than
usually sinful, by reading books and sermons as
barren as the Dead Sea. There was but one
rosy spot, in the distance, all that day: that
was ‘bed-time,’ which never could come too
early!</i>”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>“Such teaching was well meant, no doubt,”
said Arthur; “but it must have driven many of
its victims into deserting the Church-Services
altogether.”</p>
<p>“I’m afraid <i>I</i> was a deserter this morning,”
she gravely said. “I had to write to Eric.
Would you—would you mind my telling you
<span class="pb" id="Page_389">389</span>
something he said about <i>prayer</i>? It had never
struck me in that light before.”</p>
<p>“In what light?” said Arthur.</p>
<p>“Why, that all Nature goes by fixed, regular
laws—Science has proved <i>that</i>. So that asking
God to <i>do</i> anything (except of course praying
for <i>spiritual</i> blessings) is to expect a miracle:
and we’ve no right to do <i>that</i>. I’ve not put it
as well as <i>he</i> did: but that was the outcome of
it, and it has confused me. Please tell me what
you can say in answer to it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t propose to discuss <i>Captain Lindon’s</i>
difficulties,” Arthur gravely replied; “specially
as he is not present. But, if it is <i>your</i> difficulty,”
(his voice unconsciously took a tenderer
tone) “then I will speak.”</p>
<p>“It <i>is</i> my difficulty,” she said anxiously.</p>
<p>“Then I will begin by asking ‘Why did you
except <i>spiritual</i> blessings?’ Is not your mind
a part of Nature?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but Free-Will comes in there—I can
<i>choose</i> this or that; and God can influence my
choice.”</p>
<p>“Then you are not a Fatalist?”</p>
<p>“Oh, no!” she earnestly exclaimed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_390">390</div>
<p>“Thank God!” Arthur said to himself, but
in so low a whisper that only <i>I</i> heard it. “You
grant then that I can, by an act of free choice,
move this cup,” suiting the action to the word,
“<i>this</i> way or <i>that</i> way?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I grant it.”</p>
<p>“Well, let us see how far the result is produced
by fixed laws. The <i>cup</i> moves because
certain mechanical forces are impressed on it
by my <i>hand</i>. My <i>hand</i> moves because certain
forces—electric, magnetic, or whatever ‘nerve-force’
may prove to be—are impressed on it
by my <i>brain</i>. This nerve-force, stored in the
brain, would probably be traceable, if Science
were complete, to chemical forces supplied to
the brain by the blood, and ultimately derived
from the food I eat and the air I breathe.”</p>
<p>“But would not that be Fatalism? Where
would Free-Will come in?”</p>
<p>“In <i>choice</i> of nerves,” replied Arthur. “The
nerve-force in the brain may flow just as naturally
down one nerve as down another. We
need something more than a fixed Law of
Nature to settle <i>which</i> nerve shall carry it.
That ‘something’ is Free-Will.”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_391">391</div>
<p>Her eyes sparkled. “I see what you mean!”
she exclaimed. “Human Free-Will is an exception
to the system of fixed Law. Eric said
something like that. And then I think he
pointed out that God can only influence Nature
by influencing Human Wills. So that we <i>might</i>
reasonably pray ‘<i>give us this day our daily
bread</i>,’ because many of the causes that produce
bread are under Man’s control. But to pray
for rain, or fine weather, would be as unreasonable
as—” she checked herself, as if fearful of
saying something irreverent.</p>
<p>In a hushed, low tone, that trembled with
emotion, and with the solemnity of one in the
presence of death, Arthur slowly replied “<i>Shall
he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct
him?</i> Shall we, ‘the swarm that in the noontide
beam were born,’ feeling in ourselves the
power to direct, this way or that, the forces of
Nature—of <i>Nature</i>, of which we form so
trivial a part—shall we, in our boundless arrogance,
in our pitiful conceit, <i>deny</i> that power to
the Ancient of Days? Saying, to our Creator,
‘Thus far and no further. Thou madest, but
thou canst not rule!’?”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_392">392</div>
<p>Lady Muriel had covered her face in her
hands, and did not look up. She only murmured
“Thanks, thanks!” again and again.</p>
<p>We rose to go. Arthur said, with evident
effort, “One word more. If you would <i>know</i>
the power of Prayer—in anything and everything
that Man can need—<i>try</i> it. <i>Ask, and
it shall be given you.</i> I—<i>have</i> tried it. I
<i>know</i> that God answers prayer!”</p>
<p>Our walk home was a silent one, till we
had nearly reached the lodgings: then Arthur
murmured—and it was almost an echo of my
own thoughts—“<i>What knowest thou, O wife,
whether thou shalt save thy husband?</i>”</p>
<p>The subject was not touched on again. We
sat on, talking, while hour after hour, of this
our last night together, glided away unnoticed.
He had much to tell me about India, and
the new life he was going to, and the <i>work</i>
he hoped to do. And his great generous soul
seemed so filled with noble ambition as to have
no space left for any vain regret or selfish
repining.</p>
<p>“Come, it is nearly morning!” Arthur said
at last, rising and leading the way upstairs.
<span class="pb" id="Page_393">393</span>
“The sun will be rising in a few minutes:
and, though I <i>have</i> basely defrauded you of
your last chance of a night’s rest here, I’m
sure you’ll forgive me: for I really <i>couldn’t</i>
bring myself to say ‘Good night’ sooner. And
God knows whether you’ll ever see me again,
or hear of me!”</p>
<p>“<i>Hear</i> of you I am certain I shall!” I
warmly responded, and quoted the concluding
lines of that strange poem ‘Waring’:—</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t7">“Oh, never star</p>
<p class="t0">Was lost here, but it rose afar!</p>
<p class="t0">Look East, where whole new thousands are!</p>
<p class="t0">In Vishnu-land what Avatar?”</p>
</div>
<p>“Aye, look Eastward!” Arthur eagerly replied,
pausing at the stair-case window, which
commanded a fine view of the sea and the
eastward horizon. “The West is the fitting
tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing, all the
errors and the follies of the Past: for all its
withered Hopes and all its buried Loves!
From the East comes new strength, new ambition,
new Hope, new Life, new Love! Look
Eastward! Aye, look Eastward!”</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_394">394</div>
<p>His last words were still ringing in my ears
as I entered my room, and undrew the window-curtains,
just in time to see the sun burst in
glory from his ocean-prison, and clothe the
world in the light of a new day.</p>
<p>“So may it be for him, and me, and all of
us!” I mused. “All that is evil, and dead,
and hopeless, fading with the Night that is
past! All that is good, and living, and hopeful,
rising with the dawn of Day!</p>
<p>“Fading, with the Night, the chilly mists,
and the noxious vapours, and the heavy shadows,
and the wailing gusts, and the owl’s melancholy
hootings: rising, with the Day, the darting
shafts of light, and the wholesome morning
breeze, and the warmth of a dawning life,
and the mad music of the lark! Look
Eastward!</p>
<p>“Fading, with the Night, the clouds of
ignorance, and the deadly blight of sin, and
the silent tears of sorrow: and ever rising,
higher, higher, with the Day, the radiant dawn
of knowledge, and the sweet breath of purity,
and the throb of a world’s ecstasy! Look
Eastward!</p>

</div>
<p>“Fading, with the Night, the memory of
a dead love, and the withered leaves of a
blighted hope, and the sickly repinings and
moody regrets that numb the best energies of
the soul: and rising, broadening, rolling upward
like a living flood, the manly resolve, and
the dauntless will, and the heavenward gaze
of faith—<i>the substance of things hoped for,
the evidence of things not seen</i>!</p>
<p>“Look Eastward! Aye, look Eastward!”</p>

  <div class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</div>
  <h2 class="eee">PREFACE.</h2>
  <p>I must begin with the same announcement as in
  the previous Volume (which I shall henceforward
  refer to as “Vol. I.,” calling the present Volume
  “Vol. II.”), viz. that the Locket, at <a href="#Page_405" class="pginternal">p. 405</a>, was drawn
  by ‘Miss Alice Havers.’ And my reason, for not
  stating this on the title-page—that it seems only
  due, to the artist of these wonderful pictures, that
  his name should stand there alone—has, I think,
  even greater weight in Vol. II. than it had in Vol. I.
  Let me call especial attention to the three “Little
  Birds” borders, at pp. <a href="#Page_365" class="pginternal">365</a>, <a href="#Page_371" class="pginternal">371</a>, <a href="#Page_377" class="pginternal">377</a>. The way, in
  which he has managed to introduce the most minute
  details of the stanzas to be illustrated, seems to me
  a triumph of artistic ingenuity.</p>
  <p class="tb">Let me here express my sincere gratitude to the
  many Reviewers who have noticed, whether favorably
  or unfavorably, the previous Volume. Their unfavorable
  remarks were, most probably, well-deserved;
  the favorable ones less probably so. Both kinds
  have no doubt served to make the book known, and
  have helped the reading Public to form their opinions
  of it. Let me also here assure them that it is not
  from any want of respect for their criticisms, that I
  <span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
  have carefully forborne from reading <i>any</i> of them.
  I am strongly of opinion that an author had far
  better <i>not</i> read any reviews of his books: the unfavorable
  ones are almost certain to make him
  cross, and the favorable ones conceited; and <i>neither</i>
  of these results is desirable.</p>
  <p>Criticisms have, however, reached me from private
  sources, to some of which I propose to offer a reply.</p>
  <p>One such critic complains that Arthur’s strictures,
  on sermons and on choristers, are too severe. Let me
  say, in reply, that I do <i>not</i> hold myself responsible
  for <i>any</i> of the opinions expressed by the characters
  in my book. They are simply opinions which, it
  seemed to me, might probably be held by the persons
  into whose mouths I put them, and which were
  worth consideration.</p>
  <p>Other critics have objected to certain innovations
  in spelling, such as “ca’n’t,” “wo’n’t,” “traveler.” In
  reply, I can only plead my firm conviction that the
  popular usage is <i>wrong</i>. As to “ca’n’t,” it will not
  be disputed that, in all <i>other</i> words ending in “n’t,”
  these letters are an abbreviation of “not”; and it is
  surely absurd to suppose that, in this solitary instance,
  “not” is represented by “’t”! In fact “can’t” is
  the <i>proper</i> abbreviation for “can it,” just as “is’t” is
  for “is it.” Again, in “wo’n’t,” the first apostrophe
  is needed, because the word “would” is here <i>abridged</i>
  into “wo”: but I hold it proper to spell “don’t”
  with only <i>one</i> apostrophe, because the word “do” is
  here <i>complete</i>. As to such words as “traveler,” I
  hold the correct principle to be, to <i>double</i> the consonant
  <span class="pb" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
  when the accent falls on that syllable; otherwise
  to leave it <i>single</i>. This rule is observed in most
  cases (e.g. we double the “r” in “preferred,” but
  leave it single in “offered”), so that I am only extending,
  to other cases, an existing rule. I admit,
  however, that I do not spell “parallel,” as the rule
  would have it; but here we are constrained, by the
  etymology, to insert the double “l”.</p>
  <p class="tb">In the Preface to Vol. I. were two puzzles, on which
  my readers might exercise their ingenuity. One was,
  to detect the 3 lines of “padding,” which I had found
  it necessary to supply in the passage extending from
  the top of <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_35" id="id-6429806437688115808">p. 35</a> to the middle of <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_38" id="id-1643881559887496306">p. 38</a>. They are
  the 14th, 15th, and 16th lines of <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_37" id="id-3854097988354324042">p. 37</a>. The other
  puzzle was, to determine which (if any) of the 8
  stanzas of the Gardener’s Song (see pp. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_65" id="id-7938496770928067716">65</a>, <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_78" id="id-3295510837044261916">78</a>, <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_83" id="id-3722318547145985164">83</a>,

  and which (if any) had the context adapted to them.
  The last of them is the only one that was adapted to
  the context, the “Garden-Door that opened with a
  key” having been substituted for some creature (a
  Cormorant, I think) “that nestled in a tree.” At
  pp. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_78" id="id-2286829513647342370">78</a>, <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_106" id="id-9179905809395199319">106</a>, and <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_164" id="id-4030995101079638135">164</a>, the context was adapted to the
  stanza. At p. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_90" id="id-6372431994867579797">90</a>, neither stanza nor context was
  altered: the connection between them was simply a
  piece of good luck.</p>
  <p>In the Preface to Vol. I., at pp. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_ix" id="id-2240383587893420634">ix</a>., <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_x" id="id-2977716910267847697">x</a>., I gave an
  account of the making-up of the story of “Sylvie and
  Bruno.” A few more details may perhaps be acceptable
  to my Readers.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</div>
  <p>It was in 1873, as I <i>now</i> believe, that the idea
  first occurred to me that a little fairy-tale (written,
  in 1867, for “Aunt Judy’s Magazine,” under the title
  “Bruno’s Revenge”) might serve as the nucleus of a
  longer story. This I surmise, from having found the
  original draft of the last paragraph of Vol. II., dated
  1873. So that this paragraph has been waiting 20
  years for its chance of emerging into print—more
  than twice the period so cautiously recommended by
  Horace for ‘repressing’ one’s literary efforts!</p>
  <p>It was in February, 1885, that I entered into negotiations,
  with Mr. Harry Furniss, for illustrating the
  book. Most of the substance of <i>both</i> Volumes was
  then in existence in manuscript: and my original
  intention was to publish the <i>whole</i> story at once.
  In September, 1885, I received from Mr. Furniss the
  first set of drawings—the four which illustrate
  “Peter and Paul” (see I. pp. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_144" id="id-7455168007181879524">144</a>, <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_147" id="id-8122821741094655418">147</a>, <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_150" id="id-2122572353198916353">150</a>, <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_154" id="id-163840613352020739">154</a>): in
  November, 1886, I received the second set—the
  three which illustrate the Professor’s song about the
  “little man” who had “a little gun” (Vol. II. pp.
  <a href="#Page_265" class="pginternal">265</a>, <a href="#Page_266" class="pginternal">266</a>, <a href="#Page_267" class="pginternal">267</a>): and in January, 1887, I received the
  third set—the four which illustrate the “Pig-Tale.”</p>
  <p>So we went on, illustrating first one bit of the
  story, and then another, without any idea of sequence.
  And it was not till March, 1889, that, having calculated
  the number of pages the story would occupy, I
  decided on dividing it into <i>two</i> portions, and publishing
  it half at a time. This necessitated the writing
  of a <i>sort</i> of conclusion for the first Volume: and <i>most</i>
  of my Readers, I fancy, regarded this as the <i>actual</i>
  <span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
  conclusion, when that Volume appeared in December,
  1889. At any rate, among all the letters I received
  about it, there was only <i>one</i> which expressed <i>any</i> suspicion
  that it was not a <i>final</i> conclusion. This letter
  was from a child. She wrote “we were so glad,
  when we came to the end of the book, to find that
  there was no ending-up, for that shows us that you
  are going to write a sequel.”</p>
  <p>It may interest some of my Readers to know the
  <i>theory</i> on which this story is constructed. It is an
  attempt to show what might <i>possibly</i> happen, supposing
  that Fairies really existed; and that they were
  sometimes visible to us, and we to them; and that
  they were sometimes able to assume human form:
  and supposing, also, that human beings might sometimes
  become conscious of what goes on in the Fairy-world—by
  actual transference of their immaterial
  essence, such as we meet with in ‘Esoteric Buddhism.’</p>
  <p>I have supposed a Human being to be capable of
  various psychical states, with varying degrees of
  consciousness, as follows:—</p>
  <p>(<i>a</i>) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of the
  presence of Fairies;</p>
  <p>(<i>b</i>) the ‘eerie’ state, in which, while conscious of
  actual surroundings, he is <i>also</i> conscious of the presence
  of Fairies;</p>
  <p>(<i>c</i>) a form of trance, in which, while <i>un</i>conscious
  of actual surroundings, and apparently asleep, he (i.e.
  his immaterial essence) migrates to other scenes, in
  the actual world, or in Fairyland, and is conscious of
  the presence of Fairies.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</div>
  <p>I have also supposed a Fairy to be capable of migrating
  from Fairyland into the actual world, and
  of assuming, at pleasure, a Human form; and also
  to be capable of various psychical states, viz.</p>
  <p>(<i>a</i>) the ordinary state, with no consciousness of
  the presence of Human beings;</p>
  <p>(<i>b</i>) a sort of ‘eerie’ state, in which he is conscious,
  if in the actual world, of the presence of actual Human
  beings; if in Fairyland, of the presence of the immaterial
  essences of Human beings.</p>
  <p>I will here tabulate the passages, in both Volumes, where abnormal states occur.</p>

  <p>In the Preface to Vol. I., at p. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_x" id="id-1097647566694754465">x</a>., I gave an account
  of the <i>origination</i> of some of the ideas embodied in
  the book. A few more such details may perhaps interest
  my Readers:—</p>
  <p>I. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_203" id="id-7637095028068687312">p. 203</a>. The very peculiar use, here made of a
  dead mouse, comes from real life. I once found two
  very small boys, in a garden, playing a microscopic
  game of ‘Single-Wicket.’ The bat was, I think, about
  the size of a table-spoon; and the utmost distance
  attained by the ball, in its most daring flights, was
  some 4 or 5 yards. The <i>exact</i> length was of course a
  matter of <i>supreme</i> importance; and it was always
  carefully measured out (the batsman and the bowler
  amicably sharing the toil) with a dead mouse!</p>
  <p>I. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_259" id="id-3855278236527148100">p. 259</a>. The two quasi-mathematical Axioms,
  quoted by Arthur at p. 259 of Vol. I., (“Things that
  are greater than the same are greater than one
  another,” and “All angles are equal”) were actually
  enunciated, in all seriousness, by undergraduates at a
  University situated not 100 miles from Ely.</p>
  <p>II. <a href="#Page_10" class="pginternal">p. 10</a>. Bruno’s remark (“I can, if I like, &amp;c.”)
  was actually made by a little boy.</p>
  <p>II. <a href="#Page_12" class="pginternal">p. 12</a>. So also was his remark (“I know what
  it <i>doesn’t</i> spell.”) And his remark (“I just twiddled
  my eyes, &amp;c.”) I heard from the lips of a little girl,
  who had just solved a puzzle I had set her.</p>
  <p>II. <a href="#Page_57" class="pginternal">p. 57</a>. Bruno’s soliloquy (“For its father, &amp;c.”)
  was actually spoken by a little girl, looking out of
  the window of a railway-carriage.</p>
  <p>II. <a href="#Page_138" class="pginternal">p. 138</a>. The remark, made by a guest at the
  dinner-party, when asking for a dish of fruit (“I’ve
  <span class="pb" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
  been wishing for them, &amp;c.”) I heard made by the
  great Poet-Laureate, whose loss the whole reading-world
  has so lately had to deplore.</p>
  <p>II. <a href="#Page_163" class="pginternal">p. 163</a>. Bruno’s speech, on the subject of the
  age of ‘Mein Herr,’ embodies the reply of a little
  girl to the question “Is your grandmother an <i>old</i>
  lady?” “I don’t know if she’s an <i>old</i> lady,” said this
  cautious young person; “she’s <i>eighty-three</i>.”</p>
  <p>II. <a href="#Page_203" class="pginternal">p. 203</a>. The speech about ‘Obstruction’ is no
  mere creature of my imagination! It is copied <i>verbatim</i>
  from the columns of the Standard, and was
  spoken by Sir William Harcourt, who was, at the
  time, a member of the ‘Opposition,’ at the ‘National
  Liberal Club,’ on July the 16th, 1890.</p>
  <p>II. <a href="#Page_329" class="pginternal">p. 329</a>. The Professor’s remark, about a dog’s
  tail, that “it doesn’t bite at <i>that</i> end,” was actually
  made by a child, when warned of the danger he was
  incurring by pulling the dog’s tail.</p>
  <p>II. <a href="#Page_374" class="pginternal">p. 374</a>. The dialogue between Sylvie and Bruno,
  which occupies lines 6 to 15, is a <i>verbatim</i> report
  (merely substituting “cake” for “penny”) of a dialogue
  overheard between two children.</p>
  <p class="tb">One story in this Volume—‘Bruno’s Picnic’—I
  can vouch for as suitable for telling to children,
  having tested it again and again; and, whether my
  audience has been a dozen little girls in a village-school,
  or some thirty or forty in a London drawing-room,
  or a hundred in a High School, I have always
  found them earnestly attentive, and keenly appreciative
  of such fun as the story supplied.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_xvii">xvii</div>
  <p>May I take this opportunity of calling attention to
  what I flatter myself was a successful piece of name-coining,
  at <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_42" id="id-2404659226550294505">p. 42</a> of Vol. I. Does not the name
  ‘Sibimet’ fairly embody the character of the Sub-Warden?
  The gentle Reader has no doubt observed
  what a singularly useless article in a house a brazen
  trumpet is, if you simply leave it lying about, and
  never blow it!</p>
  <p>Readers of the first Volume, who have amused
  themselves by trying to solve the two puzzles propounded

  like to exercise their ingenuity in discovering which

  <p>I will publish the answer to this puzzle in the
  Preface to a little book of “Original Games and
  Puzzles,” now in course of preparation.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_xviii">xviii</div>
  <p>I have reserved, for the last, one or two rather more
  serious topics.</p>
  <p class="tb">I had intended, in this Preface, to discuss more
  fully, than I had done in the previous Volume, the
  ‘Morality of Sport’, with special reference to letters
  I have received from lovers of Sport, in which they
  point out the many great advantages which men get
  from it, and try to prove that the suffering, which it
  inflicts on animals, is too trivial to be regarded.</p>
  <p>But, when I came to think the subject out, and to
  arrange the whole of the arguments ‘pro’ and ‘con’,
  I found it much too large for treatment here. Some
  day, I hope to publish an essay on this subject. At
  present, I will content myself with stating the net
  result I have arrived at.</p>
  <p>It is, that God has given to Man an absolute right
  to take the <i>lives</i> of other animals, for <i>any</i> reasonable
  cause, such as the supply of food: but that He has
  <i>not</i> given to Man the right to inflict <i>pain</i>, unless
  when <i>necessary</i>: that mere pleasure, or advantage,
  does not constitute such a necessity: and, consequently,
  that pain, inflicted for the purposes of
  <i>Sport</i>, is cruel, and therefore wrong. But I find it a
  far more complex question than I had supposed;
  and that the ‘case’, on the side of the Sportsman, is
  a much stronger one than I had supposed. So, for
  the present, I say no more about it.</p>
  <p class="tb">Objections have been raised to the severe language
  I have put into the mouth of ‘Arthur’, at p. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_277" id="id-1914956262962432825">277</a>, on
  <span class="pb" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
  the subject of ‘Sermons,’ and at pp. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_273" id="id-464066851668932543">273</a>, <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_274" id="id-742875844672768445">274</a>, on the
  subjects of Choral Services and ‘Choristers.’</p>
  <p>I have already protested against the assumption
  that I am ready to endorse the opinions of characters
  in my story. But, in these two instances, I admit
  that I am much in sympathy with ‘Arthur.’ In my
  opinion, far too many sermons are expected from our
  preachers; and, as a consequence, a great many are
  preached, which are not worth listening to; and, as a
  consequence of <i>that</i>, we are very apt <i>not</i> to listen.
  The reader of this paragraph probably heard a sermon
  last Sunday morning? Well, let him, if he can, name
  the text, and state how the preacher treated it!</p>
  <p>Then, as to ‘Choristers,’ and all the other accessories—of
  music, vestments, processions, &amp;c.,—which
  have come, along with them, into fashion—while freely
  admitting that the ‘Ritual’ movement was sorely
  needed, and that it has effected a vast improvement
  in our Church-Services, which had become dead and
  dry to the last degree, I hold that, like many other
  desirable movements, it has gone too far in the opposite
  direction, and has introduced many new dangers.</p>
  <p>For the Congregation this new movement involves
  the danger of learning to think that the Services are
  done <i>for</i> them; and that their bodily <i>presence</i> is all
  they need contribute. And, for Clergy and Congregation
  alike, it involves the danger of regarding
  these elaborate Services as <i>ends in themselves</i>, and
  of forgetting that they are simply <i>means</i>, and the
  very hollowest of mockeries, unless they bear fruit in
  our <i>lives</i>.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_xx">xx</div>
  <p>For the Choristers it seems to involve the danger
  of self-conceit, as described at p. <a class="x pgexternal" href="file:///public/vhost/g/gutenberg/html/files/48630/48630-h/48630-h.htm#Page_274" id="id-6044670569358840768">274</a>, the
  danger of regarding those parts of the Service, where
  their help is not required, as not worth attending to,
  the danger of coming to regard the Service as a mere
  outward form—a series of postures to be assumed,
  and of words to be said or sung, while the <i>thoughts</i>
  are elsewhere—and the danger of ‘familiarity’
  breeding ‘contempt’ for sacred things.</p>
  <p>Let me illustrate these last two forms of danger,
  from my own experience. Not long ago, I attended
  a Cathedral-Service, and was placed immediately
  behind a row of men, members of the Choir; and I
  could not help noticing that they treated the <i>Lessons</i>
  as a part of the Service to which they needed not to
  give <i>any</i> attention, and as affording them a convenient
  opportunity for arranging music-books, &amp;c., &amp;c. Also
  I have frequently seen a row of little choristers, after
  marching in procession to their places, kneel down, as
  if about to pray, and rise from their knees after a
  minute spent in looking about them, it being but too
  evident that the attitude was a mere mockery. Surely
  it is very dangerous, for these children, to thus accustom
  them to <i>pretend</i> to pray? As an instance of
  irreverent treatment of holy things, I will mention a
  custom, which no doubt many of my readers have
  noticed in Churches where the Clergy and Choir enter
  in procession, viz. that, at the end of the private devotions,
  which are carried on in the vestry, and which
  are of course inaudible to the Congregation, the final
  <span class="pb" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
  “Amen” is <i>shouted</i>, loud enough to be heard all
  through the Church. This serves as a signal, to the
  Congregation, to prepare to rise when the procession
  appears: and it admits of no dispute that it is for this
  purpose that it is thus shouted. When we remember
  to Whom that “Amen” is <i>really</i> addressed, and consider
  that it is here <i>used</i> for the same purpose as one
  of the Church-bells, we must surely admit that it is a
  piece of gross irreverence? To <i>me</i> it is much as if
  I were to see a Bible used as a footstool.</p>
  <p>As an instance of the dangers, for the Clergy
  themselves, introduced by this new movement, let
  me mention the fact that, according to <i>my</i> experience,
  Clergymen of this school are <i>specially</i> apt to
  retail comic anecdotes, in which the most sacred
  names and words—sometimes actual texts from
  the Bible—are used as themes for jesting. Many
  such things are repeated as having been originally
  said by <i>children</i>, whose utter ignorance of evil must
  no doubt acquit <i>them</i>, in the sight of God, of all
  blame; but it must be otherwise for those who
  <i>consciously</i> use such innocent utterances as material
  for their unholy mirth.</p>
  <p>Let me add, however, <i>most</i> earnestly, that I fully
  believe that this profanity is, in many cases, <i>un</i>conscious:
  the ‘environment’ (as I have tried to explain
  at <a href="#Page_123" class="pginternal">p. 123</a>) makes all the difference between man and
  man; and I rejoice to think that many of these profane
  stories—which <i>I</i> find so painful to listen to,
  and should feel it a sin to repeat—give to <i>their</i> ears
  no pain, and to <i>their</i> consciences no shock; and that
  <span class="pb" id="Page_xxii">xxii</span>
  <i>they</i> can utter, not less sincerely than myself, the
  two prayers, “<i>Hallowed be Thy Name</i>” and “<i>from
  hardness of heart, and contempt of Thy Word and
  Commandment, Good Lord, deliver us!</i>” To which
  I would desire to add, for their sake and for my own,
  Keble’s beautiful petition, “<i>help us, this and every day,
  To live more nearly as we pray!</i>” It is, in fact, for
  its <i>consequences</i>—for the grave dangers, both to speaker
  and to hearer, which it involves—rather than for what
  it is <i>in itself</i>, that I mourn over this clerical habit of
  profanity in social talk. To the <i>believing</i> hearer it
  brings the danger of loss of reverence for holy things,
  by the mere act of listening to, and enjoying, such
  jests; and also the temptation to retail them for the
  amusement of others. To the <i>unbelieving</i> hearer it
  brings a welcome confirmation of his theory that
  religion is a fable, in the spectacle of its accredited
  champions thus betraying their trust. And to the
  speaker himself it must surely bring the danger of
  <i>loss of faith</i>. For surely such jests, if uttered with
  no consciousness of harm, must necessarily be also
  uttered with no consciousness, at the moment, of the
  <i>reality</i> of God, as a <i>living being</i>, who hears all we say.
  And he, who allows himself the habit of thus uttering
  holy words, with no thought of their meaning, is but
  too likely to find that, for him, God has become a
  myth, and heaven a poetic fancy—that, for him, the
  light of life is gone, and that he is at heart an atheist,
  lost in “<i>a darkness that may be felt</i>.”</p>
  <p>There is, I fear, at the present time, an increasing
  tendency to irreverent treatment of the name of God
  <span class="pb" id="Page_xxiii">xxiii</span>
  and of subjects connected with religion. Some of
  our theatres are helping this downward movement by
  the gross caricatures of clergymen which they put
  upon the stage: some of our clergy are themselves
  helping it, by showing that they can lay aside the
  spirit of reverence, along with their surplices, and can
  treat as jests, when <i>outside</i> their churches, names and
  things to which they pay an almost superstitious
  veneration when <i>inside</i>: the “Salvation Army” has,
  I fear, with the best intentions, done much to help it,
  by the coarse familiarity with which they treat holy
  things: and surely every one, who desires to <i>live</i> in
  the spirit of the prayer “<i>Hallowed be thy Name</i>,”
  ought to do what he can, however little that may be,
  to check it. So I have gladly taken this unique
  opportunity, however unfit the topic may seem for the
  Preface to a book of this kind, to express some
  thoughts which have weighed on my mind for a long
  time. I did not expect, when I wrote the Preface to
  Vol. I, that it would be read to any appreciable extent:
  but I rejoice to believe, from evidence that has
  reached me, that it <i>has</i> been read by many, and to
  hope that this Preface will also be so: and I think
  that, among them, some will be found ready to
  sympathise with the views I have put forwards, and
  ready to help, with their prayers and their example,
  the revival, in Society, of the waning spirit of
  reverence.</p>

  <h1 title="">SYLVIE AND BRUNO
  <br>CONCLUDED.</h1>
  <h2 id="c1">CHAPTER I.
  <br><span class="small">BRUNO’S LESSONS.</span></h2>
  <p>During the next month or two my solitary
  town-life seemed, by contrast, unusually dull
  and tedious. I missed the pleasant friends I
  had left behind at Elveston—the genial interchange
  of thought—the sympathy which gave
  to one’s ideas a new and vivid reality: but,
  perhaps more than all, I missed the companionship
  of the two Fairies—or Dream-Children,
  for I had not yet solved the problem as to
  who or what they were—whose sweet playfulness
  had shed a magic radiance over my life.</p>
  <p>In office-hours—which I suppose reduce
  most men to the mental condition of a coffee-mill
  <span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
  or a mangle—time sped along much as
  usual: it was in the pauses of life, the desolate
  hours when books and newspapers palled on
  the sated appetite, and when, thrown back
  upon one’s own dreary musings, one strove—all
  in vain—to people the vacant air with the
  dear faces of absent friends, that the real bitterness
  of solitude made itself felt.</p>
  <p>One evening, feeling my life a little more
  wearisome than usual, I strolled down to my
  Club, not so much with the hope of meeting
  any friend there, for London was now ‘out of
  town,’ as with the feeling that here, at least,
  I should hear ‘sweet words of human speech,’
  and come into contact with human thought.</p>
  <p>However, almost the first face I saw there
  <i>was</i> that of a friend. Eric Lindon was lounging,
  with rather a ‘bored’ expression of face,
  over a newspaper; and we fell into conversation
  with a mutual satisfaction which neither
  of us tried to conceal.</p>
  <p>After a while I ventured to introduce what
  was just then the main subject of my thoughts.
  “And so the Doctor” (a name we had adopted
  by a tacit agreement, as a convenient compromise
  <span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
  between the formality of ‘Doctor
  Forester’ and the intimacy—to which Eric
  Lindon hardly seemed entitled—of ‘Arthur’)
  “has gone abroad by this time, I suppose?
  Can you give me his present address?”</p>
  <p>“He is still at Elveston—I believe,” was
  the reply. “But I have not been there since
  I last met you.”</p>
  <p>I did not know which part of this intelligence
  to wonder at most. “And might I ask—if
  it isn’t taking too much of a liberty—when
  your wedding-bells are to—or perhaps they
  <i>have</i> rung, already?”</p>
  <p>“No,” said Eric, in a steady voice, which
  betrayed scarcely a trace of emotion: “<i>that</i> engagement
  is at an end. I am still ‘Benedick
  the <i>un</i>married man.’”</p>
  <p>After this, the thick-coming fancies—all
  radiant with new possibilities of happiness for
  Arthur—were far too bewildering to admit of
  any further conversation, and I was only too
  glad to avail myself of the first decent excuse,
  that offered itself, for retiring into silence.</p>
  <p>The next day I wrote to Arthur, with as
  much of a reprimand for his long silence as I
  <span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
  could bring myself to put into words, begging
  him to tell me how the world went with him.</p>
  <p>Needs must that three or four days—possibly
  more—should elapse before I could
  receive his reply; and never had I known days
  drag their slow length along with a more tedious
  indolence.</p>
  <p>To while away the time, I strolled, one afternoon,
  into Kensington Gardens, and, wandering
  aimlessly along any path that presented itself,
  I soon became aware that I had somehow
  strayed into one that was wholly new to me.
  Still, my elfish experiences seemed to have so
  completely faded out of my life that nothing
  was further from my thoughts than the idea of
  again meeting my fairy-friends, when I chanced
  to notice a small creature, moving among the
  grass that fringed the path, that did not seem
  to be an insect, or a frog, or any other living
  thing that I could think of. Cautiously kneeling
  down, and making an <i>ex tempore</i> cage of
  my two hands, I imprisoned the little wanderer,
  and felt a sudden thrill of surprise and delight
  on discovering that my prisoner was no other
  than <i>Bruno</i> himself!</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
  <p>Bruno took the matter <i>very</i> coolly, and, when
  I had replaced him on the ground, where he
  would be within easy conversational distance,
  he began talking, just as if it were only a few
  minutes since last we had met.</p>
  <p>“Doos oo know what the <i>Rule</i> is,” he enquired,
  “when oo catches a Fairy, withouten
  its having tolded oo where it was?” (Bruno’s
  notions of English Grammar had certainly <i>not</i>
  improved since our last meeting.)</p>
  <p>“No,” I said. “I didn’t know there was any
  Rule about it.”</p>
  <p>“I <i>think</i> oo’ve got a right to <i>eat</i> me,” said
  the little fellow, looking up into my face with a
  winning smile. “But I’m not pruffickly sure.
  Oo’d better not do it wizout asking.”</p>
  <p>It did indeed seem reasonable not to take so
  irrevocable a step as <i>that</i>, without due enquiry.
  “I’ll certainly <i>ask</i> about it, first,” I said. “Besides,
  I don’t know yet whether you would be
  <i>worth</i> eating!”</p>
  <p>“I guess I’m <i>deliciously</i> good to eat,” Bruno
  remarked in a satisfied tone, as if it were something
  to be rather proud of.</p>
  <p>“And what are you doing here, Bruno?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
  <p>“<i>That’s</i> not my name!” said my cunning
  little friend. “Don’t oo know my name’s ‘Oh
  Bruno!’? That’s what Sylvie always calls me,
  when I says mine lessons.”</p>
  <p>“Well then, what are you doing here, oh
  Bruno?”</p>
  <p>“Doing mine lessons, a-course!” With
  that roguish twinkle in his eye, that always
  came when he knew he was talking nonsense.</p>
  <p>“Oh, <i>that’s</i> the way you do your lessons,
  is it? And do you remember them well?”</p>
  <p>“Always can ’member <i>mine</i> lessons,” said
  Bruno. “It’s <i>Sylvie’s</i> lessons that’s so <i>dreffully</i>
  hard to ’member!” He frowned, as if in
  agonies of thought, and tapped his forehead
  with his knuckles. “I <i>ca’n’t</i> think enough to
  understand them!” he said despairingly. “It
  wants <i>double</i> thinking, I believe!”</p>
  <p>“But where’s Sylvie gone?”</p>
  <p>“That’s just what <i>I</i> want to know!” said
  Bruno disconsolately. “What ever’s the good
  of setting me lessons, when she isn’t here to
  ’splain the hard bits?”</p>
  <p>“<i>I’ll</i> find her for you!” I volunteered; and,
  getting up, I wandered round the tree under
  <span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
  whose shade I had been reclining, looking on
  all sides for Sylvie. In another minute I <i>again</i>
  noticed some strange thing moving among the
  grass, and, kneeling down, was immediately
  confronted with Sylvie’s innocent face, lighted
  up with a joyful surprise at seeing me, and was
  accosted, in the sweet voice I knew so well,
  with what seemed to be the <i>end</i> of a sentence
  whose beginning I had failed to catch.</p>
  <p>“—and I think he ought to have <i>finished</i>
  them by this time. So I’m going back to him.
  Will you come too? It’s only just round at
  the other side of this tree.”</p>
  <p>It was but a few steps for <i>me</i>; but it was a
  great many for Sylvie; and I had to be very
  careful to walk slowly, in order not to leave
  the little creature so far behind as to lose
  sight of her.</p>
  <p>To find Bruno’s <i>lessons</i> was easy enough:
  they appeared to be neatly written out on large
  smooth ivy-leaves, which were scattered in some
  confusion over a little patch of ground where
  the grass had been worn away; but the pale
  student, who ought by rights to have been
  bending over them, was nowhere to be seen:
  <span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
  we looked in all directions, for some time, in
  vain; but at last Sylvie’s sharp eyes detected
  him, swinging on a tendril of ivy, and Sylvie’s
  stern voice commanded his instant return to
  <i>terra firma</i> and to the business of Life.</p>

  <div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
  <p>“Pleasure first and business afterwards”
  seemed to be the motto of these tiny folk, so
  many hugs and kisses had to be interchanged
  before anything else could be done.</p>
  <p>“Now, Bruno,” Sylvie said reproachfully,
  “didn’t I tell you you were to go on with your
  lessons, unless you heard to the contrary?”</p>
  <p>“But I <i>did</i> heard to the contrary!” Bruno
  insisted, with a mischievous twinkle in his eye.</p>
  <p>“<i>What</i> did you hear, you wicked boy?”</p>
  <p>“It were a sort of noise in the air,” said
  Bruno: “a sort of a scrambling noise. Didn’t
  <i>oo</i> hear it, Mister Sir?”</p>
  <p>“Well, anyhow, you needn’t go to <i>sleep</i> over
  them, you lazy-lazy!” For Bruno had curled
  himself up, on the largest ‘lesson,’ and was
  arranging another as a pillow.</p>
  <p>“I <i>wasn’t</i> asleep!” said Bruno, in a deeply-injured
  tone. “When I shuts mine eyes, it’s
  to show that I’m <i>awake</i>!”</p>
  <p>“Well, how much have you learned, then?”</p>
  <p>“I’ve learned a little tiny bit,” said Bruno,
  modestly, being evidently afraid of overstating
  his achievement. “<i>Ca’n’t</i> learn no more!”</p>
  <p>“Oh Bruno! You know you <i>can</i>, if you like.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_10">10</div>
  <p>“Course I can, if I <i>like</i>,” the pale student
  replied; “but I ca’n’t if I <i>don’t</i> like!”</p>
  <p>Sylvie had a way—which I could not too
  highly admire—of evading Bruno’s logical
  perplexities by suddenly striking into a new
  line of thought; and this masterly stratagem
  she now adopted.</p>
  <p>“Well, I must say <i>one</i> thing——”</p>
  <p>“Did oo know, Mister Sir,” Bruno thoughtfully
  remarked, “that Sylvie ca’n’t count?
  Whenever she says ‘I must say <i>one</i> thing,’ I
  <i>know</i> quite well she’ll say <i>two</i> things! And
  she always doos.”</p>
  <p>“Two heads are better than one, Bruno,” I
  said, but with no very distinct idea as to what
  I meant by it.</p>
  <p>“I shouldn’t mind having two <i>heads</i>,” Bruno
  said softly to himself: “one head to eat mine
  dinner, and one head to argue wiz Sylvie—doos
  oo think oo’d look prettier if oo’d got
  <i>two</i> heads, Mister Sir?”</p>
  <p>The case did not, I assured him, admit of a
  doubt.</p>
  <p>“The reason why Sylvie’s so cross——”
  Bruno went on very seriously, almost sadly.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
  <p>Sylvie’s eyes grew large and round with
  surprise at this new line of enquiry—her rosy
  face being perfectly radiant with good humour.
  But she said nothing.</p>
  <p>“Wouldn’t it be better to tell me after the
  lessons are over?” I suggested.</p>
  <p>“Very well,” Bruno said with a resigned air:
  “only she wo’n’t be cross then.”</p>
  <p>“There’s only three lessons to do,” said Sylvie.
  “Spelling, and Geography, and Singing.”</p>
  <p>“Not <i>Arithmetic</i>?” I said.</p>
  <p>“No, he hasn’t a head for Arithmetic——”</p>
  <p>“Course I haven’t!” said Bruno. “Mine
  head’s for <i>hair</i>. I haven’t got a <i>lot</i> of heads!”</p>
  <p>“—and he ca’n’t learn his Multiplication-table——”</p>
  <p>“I like <i>History</i> ever so much better,” Bruno
  remarked. “Oo has to <i>repeat</i> that Muddlecome
  table——”</p>
  <p>“Well, and you have to repeat——”</p>
  <p>“No, oo hasn’t!” Bruno interrupted. “History
  repeats itself. The Professor said so!”</p>
  <p>Sylvie was arranging some letters on a
  board——E—V—I—L. “Now, Bruno,” she
  said, “what does <i>that</i> spell?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
  <p>Bruno looked at it, in solemn silence, for a
  minute. “I knows what it <i>doosn’t</i> spell!” he
  said at last.</p>
  <p>“That’s no good,” said Sylvie. “What <i>does</i>
  it spell?”</p>
  <p>Bruno took another look at the mysterious
  letters. “Why, it’s ‘LIVE,’ backwards!” he
  exclaimed. (I thought it was, indeed.)</p>
  <p>“How <i>did</i> you manage to see that?” said
  Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“I just twiddled my eyes,” said Bruno,
  “and then I saw it directly. Now may I
  sing the King-fisher Song?”</p>
  <p>“Geography next,” said Sylvie. “Don’t you
  know the Rules?”</p>
  <p>“I thinks there oughtn’t to be such a lot of
  Rules, Sylvie! I thinks——”</p>
  <p>“Yes, there <i>ought</i> to be such a lot of Rules,
  you wicked, wicked boy! And how dare you
  <i>think</i> at all about it? And shut up that
  mouth directly!”</p>
  <p>So, as ‘that mouth’ didn’t seem inclined to
  shut up of itself, Sylvie shut it for him—with
  both hands—and sealed it with a kiss, just as
  you would fasten up a letter.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
  <p>“Now that Bruno is fastened up from
  talking,” she went on, turning to me, “I’ll
  show you the Map he does his lessons on.”</p>
  <p>And there it was, a large Map of the World,
  spread out on the ground. It was so large that
  Bruno had to crawl about on it, to point out the
  places named in the ‘King-fisher Lesson.’</p>
  <p>“When a King-fisher sees a Lady-bird flying
  away, he says ‘<i>Ceylon</i>, if you <i>Candia</i>!’ And
  when he catches it, he says ‘Come to <i>Media</i>!
  And if you’re <i>Hungary</i> or thirsty, I’ll give you
  some <i>Nubia</i>!’ When he takes it in his claws,
  he says ‘<i>Europe!</i>’ When he puts it into his
  beak, he says ‘<i>India!</i>’ When he’s swallowed
  it, he says ‘<i>Eton!</i>’ That’s all.”</p>
  <p>“That’s <i>quite</i> perfect,” said Sylvie. “Now
  you may sing the King-fisher Song.”</p>
  <p>“Will <i>oo</i> sing the chorus?” Bruno said to me.</p>
  <p>I was just beginning to say “I’m afraid I
  don’t know the <i>words</i>,” when Sylvie silently
  turned the map over, and I found the words
  were all written on the back. In one respect
  it was a <i>very</i> peculiar song: the chorus to each
  verse came in the <i>middle</i>, instead of at the <i>end</i>
  of it. However, the tune was so easy that I
  <span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
  soon picked it up, and managed the chorus as
  well, perhaps, as it is possible for <i>one</i> person to
  manage such a thing. It was in vain that I
  signed to Sylvie to help me: she only smiled
  sweetly and shook her head.</p>

  <p>“So he went away,” Bruno added as a kind
  of postscript, when the last note of the song
  had died away. “Just like he always did.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, my <i>dear</i> Bruno!” Sylvie exclaimed,
  with her hands over her ears. “You shouldn’t
  say ‘like’: you should say ‘<i>what</i>.’”</p>
  <p>To which Bruno replied, doggedly, “I only
  says ‘what!’ when oo doosn’t speak loud, so
  as I can hear oo.”</p>
  <p>“Where did he go to?” I asked, hoping to
  prevent an argument.</p>
  <p>“He went more far than he’d never been
  before,” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“You should never say ‘more far,’” Sylvie
  corrected him: “you should say ‘<i>farther</i>.’”</p>
  <p>“Then <i>oo</i> shouldn’t say ‘more broth,’ when
  we’re at dinner,” Bruno retorted: “oo should
  say ‘<i>brother</i>’!”</p>
  <p>This time Sylvie evaded an argument by
  turning away, and beginning to roll up the
  Map. “Lessons are over!” she proclaimed
  in her sweetest tones.</p>
  <p>“And has there been no <i>crying</i> over them?”
  I enquired. “Little boys <i>always</i> cry over their
  lessons, don’t they?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
  <p>“I never cries after twelve o’clock,” said
  Bruno: “’cause then it’s getting so near to
  dinner-time.”</p>
  <p>“Sometimes, in the morning,” Sylvie said in
  a low voice; “when it’s Geography-day, and
  when he’s been disobe——”</p>
  <p>“<i>What</i> a fellow you are to talk, Sylvie!”
  Bruno hastily interposed. “Doos oo think
  the world was <i>made</i> for oo to talk in?”</p>
  <p>“Why, where would you <i>have</i> me talk,
  then?” Sylvie said, evidently quite ready for
  an argument.</p>
  <p>But Bruno answered resolutely. “I’m not
  going to argue about it, ’cause it’s getting late,
  and there wo’n’t be time—but oo’s as ’ong as
  ever oo can be!” And he rubbed the back of
  his hand across his eyes, in which tears were
  beginning to glitter.</p>
  <p><i>Sylvie’s</i> eyes filled with tears in a moment.
  “I didn’t mean it, Bruno, <i>darling</i>!” she whispered;
  and the rest of the argument was lost
  ‘amid the tangles of Neæra’s hair,’ while the
  two disputants hugged and kissed each other.</p>
  <p>But this new form of argument was brought
  to a sudden end by a flash of lightning, which
  <span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
  was closely followed by a peal of thunder, and
  by a torrent of rain-drops, which came hissing
  and spitting, almost like live creatures, through
  the leaves of the tree that sheltered us.</p>
  <p>“Why, it’s raining cats and dogs!” I said.</p>
  <p>“And all the <i>dogs</i> has come down <i>first</i>,”
  said Bruno: “there’s nothing but <i>cats</i> coming
  down now!”</p>
  <p>In another minute the pattering ceased, as
  suddenly as it had begun. I stepped out from
  under the tree, and found that the storm was
  over; but I looked in vain, on my return, for
  my tiny companions. They had vanished with
  the storm, and there was nothing for it but to
  make the best of my way home.</p>
  <p>On the table lay, awaiting my return, an
  envelope of that peculiar yellow tint which
  always announces a telegram, and which must
  be, in the memories of so many of us, inseparably
  linked with some great and sudden
  sorrow—something that has cast a shadow,
  never in this world to be wholly lifted off, on
  the brightness of Life. No doubt it has <i>also</i>
  heralded—for many of us—some sudden
  news of joy; but this, I think, is less common:
  <span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
  human life seems, on the whole, to contain
  more of sorrow than of joy. And yet the
  world goes on. Who knows why?</p>
  <p>This time, however, there was no shock of
  sorrow to be faced: in fact, the few words it
  contained (“Could not bring myself to write.
  Come soon. Always welcome. A letter follows
  this. Arthur.”) seemed so like Arthur himself
  speaking, that it gave me quite a thrill of
  pleasure, and I at once began the preparations
  needed for the journey.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
  <h2 id="c2">CHAPTER II.
  <br><span class="small">LOVE’S CURFEW.</span></h2>
  <p>“Fayfield Junction! Change for Elveston!”</p>
  <p>What subtle memory could there be, linked
  to these commonplace words, that caused such
  a flood of happy thoughts to fill my brain? I
  dismounted from the carriage in a state of
  joyful excitement for which I could not at first
  account. True, I had taken this very journey,
  and at the same hour of the day, six months
  ago; but many things had happened since
  then, and an old man’s memory has but a
  slender hold on recent events: I sought ‘the
  missing link’ in vain. Suddenly I caught
  sight of a bench—the only one provided on
  <span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
  the cheerless platform—with a lady seated
  on it, and the whole forgotten scene flashed
  upon me as vividly as if it were happening
  over again.</p>
  <p>“Yes,” I thought. “This bare platform is,
  for me, rich with the memory of a dear friend!
  She was sitting on that very bench, and invited
  me to share it, with some quotation from
  Shakespeare—I forget what. I’ll try the
  Earl’s plan for the Dramatisation of Life, and
  fancy that figure to be Lady Muriel; and I
  won’t undeceive myself too soon!”</p>
  <p>So I strolled along the platform, resolutely
  ‘making-believe’ (as children say) that the
  casual passenger, seated on that bench, was
  the Lady Muriel I remembered so well. She
  was facing away from me, which aided the
  elaborate cheatery I was practising on myself:
  but, though I was careful, in passing the spot,
  to look the other way, in order to prolong the
  pleasant illusion, it was inevitable that, when I
  turned to walk back again, I should see who
  it was. It was Lady Muriel herself!</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>

  <p class="center small">‘SPEND IT ALL FOR MINNIE’</p>
  </div>
  <p>The whole scene now returned vividly to
  my memory; and, to make this repetition of
  it stranger still, there was the same old man,
  whom I remembered seeing so roughly ordered
  off, by the Station-Master, to make room for
  his titled passenger. The same, but ‘with a
  difference’: no longer tottering feebly along
  the platform, but actually seated at Lady
  Muriel’s side, and in conversation with her!
  “Yes, put it in your purse,” she was saying,
  “and remember you’re to spend it all for
  <i>Minnie</i>. And mind you bring her something
  nice, that’ll do her real good! And give her
  <span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
  my love!” So intent was she on saying these
  words, that, although the sound of my footstep
  had made her lift her head and look at me,
  she did not at first recognise me.</p>
  <p>I raised my hat as I approached, and then
  there flashed across her face a genuine look
  of joy, which so exactly recalled the sweet face
  of Sylvie, when last we met in Kensington
  Gardens, that I felt quite bewildered.</p>
  <p>Rather than disturb the poor old man at her
  side, she rose from her seat, and joined me in
  my walk up and down the platform, and for a
  minute or two our conversation was as utterly
  trivial and commonplace as if we were merely
  two casual guests in a London drawing-room.
  Each of us seemed to shrink, just at first,
  from touching on the deeper interests which
  linked our lives together.</p>
  <p>The Elveston train had drawn up at the
  platform, while we talked; and, in obedience
  to the Station-Master’s obsequious hint of
  “This way, my Lady! Time’s up!”, we were
  making the best of our way towards the end
  which contained the sole first-class carriage,
  and were just passing the now-empty bench,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
  when Lady Muriel noticed, lying on it, the
  purse in which her gift had just been so
  carefully bestowed, the owner of which, all
  unconscious of his loss, was being helped into
  a carriage at the other end of the train. She
  pounced on it instantly. “Poor old man!”
  she cried. “He mustn’t go off, and think
  he’s lost it!”</p>
  <p>“Let <i>me</i> run with it! I can go quicker
  than you!” I said. But she was already
  half-way down the platform, flying (‘running’
  is much too mundane a word for such fairy-like
  motion) at a pace that left all possible
  efforts of <i>mine</i> hopelessly in the rear.</p>
  <p>She was back again before I had well completed
  my audacious boast of speed in running,
  and was saying, quite demurely, as we entered
  our carriage, “and you really think <i>you</i> could
  have done it quicker?”</p>
  <p>“No indeed!” I replied. “I plead ‘Guilty’
  of gross exaggeration, and throw myself on the
  mercy of the Court!”</p>
  <p>“The Court will overlook it—for this
  once!” Then her manner suddenly changed
  from playfulness to an anxious gravity.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
  <p>“You are not looking your best!” she said
  with an anxious glance. “In fact, I think you
  look <i>more</i> of an invalid than when you left us.
  I very much doubt if London agrees with you?”</p>
  <p>“It <i>may</i> be the London air,” I said, “or it
  may be the hard work—or my rather lonely
  life: anyhow, I’ve <i>not</i> been feeling very well,
  lately. But Elveston will soon set me up
  again. Arthur’s prescription—he’s my doctor,
  you know, and I heard from him this morning—is
  ‘plenty of ozone, and new milk, and
  <i>pleasant society</i>’!”</p>
  <p>“Pleasant society?” said Lady Muriel, with
  a pretty make-believe of considering the
  question. “Well, really I don’t know where
  we can find <i>that</i> for you! We have so few
  neighbours. But new milk we <i>can</i> manage. Do
  get it of my old friend Mrs. Hunter, up there,
  on the hill-side. You may rely upon the
  <i>quality</i>. And her little Bessie comes to school
  every day, and passes your lodgings. So it
  would be very easy to send it.”</p>
  <p>“I’ll follow your advice, with pleasure,” I
  said; “and I’ll go and arrange about it tomorrow.
  I know Arthur will want a walk.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
  <p>“You’ll find it quite an easy walk—under
  three miles, I think.”</p>
  <p>“Well, now that we’ve settled that point, let
  me retort your own remark upon yourself. I
  don’t think <i>you’re</i> looking quite your best!”</p>
  <p>“I daresay not,” she replied in a low voice;
  and a sudden shadow seemed to overspread her
  face. “I’ve had some troubles lately. It’s a
  matter about which I’ve been long wishing to
  consult you, but I couldn’t easily write about
  it. I’m <i>so</i> glad to have this opportunity!”</p>
  <p>“Do you think,” she began again, after a
  minute’s silence, and with a visible embarrassment
  of manner most unusual in her, “that
  a promise, deliberately and solemnly given, is
  <i>always</i> binding—except, of course, where its
  fulfilment would involve some actual <i>sin</i>?”</p>
  <p>“I ca’n’t think of any other exception at this
  moment,” I said. “That branch of casuistry
  is usually, I believe, treated as a question of
  truth and untruth——”</p>
  <p>“Surely that <i>is</i> the principle?” she eagerly
  interrupted. “I always thought the Bible-teaching
  about it consisted of such texts as
  ‘<i>lie not one to another</i>’?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
  <p>“I have thought about that point,” I replied;
  “and it seems to me that the essence of
  <i>lying</i> is the intention of <i>deceiving</i>. If you give
  a promise, fully <i>intending</i> to fulfil it, you are
  certainly acting truthfully <i>then</i>; and, if you
  afterwards break it, that does not involve
  any <i>deception</i>. I cannot call it <i>untruthful</i>.”</p>
  <p>Another pause of silence ensued. Lady
  Muriel’s face was hard to read: she looked
  pleased, I thought, but also puzzled; and I
  felt curious to know whether her question
  had, as I began to suspect, some bearing on
  the breaking off of her engagement with
  Captain (now Major) Lindon.</p>
  <p>“You have relieved me from a great fear,”
  she said; “but the thing is of course <i>wrong</i>,
  somehow. What texts would <i>you</i> quote, to
  prove it wrong?”</p>
  <p>“Any that enforce the payment of <i>debts</i>.
  If <i>A</i> promises something to <i>B</i>, <i>B</i> has a claim
  upon <i>A</i>. And <i>A</i>’s sin, if he breaks his
  promise, seems to me more analogous to
  <i>stealing</i> than to <i>lying</i>.”</p>
  <p>“It’s a new way of looking at it—to me,”
  she said; “but it seems a <i>true</i> way, also.
  <span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
  However, I won’t deal in generalities, with
  an old friend like you! For we <i>are</i> old
  friends, somehow. Do you know, I think we
  <i>began</i> as old friends?” she said with a playfulness
  of tone that ill accorded with the tears
  that glistened in her eyes.</p>
  <p>“Thank you very much for saying so,” I
  replied. “I like to think of you as an <i>old</i>
  friend,” (“—though you don’t look it!” would
  have been the almost necessary sequence, with
  any other lady; but she and I seemed to have
  long passed out of the time when compliments,
  or any such trivialities, were possible.)</p>
  <p>Here the train paused at a station, where
  two or three passengers entered the carriage;
  so no more was said till we had reached our
  journey’s end.</p>
  <p>On our arrival at Elveston, she readily
  adopted my suggestion that we should walk
  up together; so, as soon as our luggage had
  been duly taken charge of—hers by the servant
  who met her at the station, and mine by
  one of the porters—we set out together along
  the familiar lanes, now linked in my memory
  with so many delightful associations. Lady
  <span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
  Muriel at once recommenced the conversation
  at the point where it had been interrupted.</p>
  <p>“You knew of my engagement to my
  cousin Eric. Did you also hear——”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” I interrupted, anxious to spare her
  the pain of giving any details. “I heard it
  had all come to an end.”</p>
  <p>“I would like to tell you how it happened,”
  she said; “as that is the very point I want
  your advice about. I had long realised that
  we were not in sympathy in religious belief.
  His ideas of Christianity are very shadowy;
  and even as to the existence of a God he lives
  in a sort of dreamland. But it has not affected
  his life! I feel sure, now, that the most absolute
  Atheist <i>may</i> be leading, though walking
  blindfold, a pure and noble life. And if you
  knew half the good deeds——” she broke off
  suddenly, and turned away her head.</p>
  <p>“I entirely agree with you,” I said. “And
  have we not our Saviour’s own promise that
  such a life shall surely lead to the light?”</p>
  <p>“Yes, I know it,” she said in a broken voice,
  still keeping her head turned away. “And so
  I told him. He said he would believe, for <i>my</i>
  <span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
  sake, if he could. And he wished, for <i>my</i> sake,
  he could see things as I did. But that is all
  wrong!” she went on passionately. “God
  <i>cannot</i> approve such low motives as that!
  Still it was not <i>I</i> that broke it off. I knew
  he loved me; and I had <i>promised</i>; and——”</p>
  <p>“Then it was <i>he</i> that broke it off?”</p>
  <p>“He released me unconditionally.” She
  faced me again now, having quite recovered
  her usual calmness of manner.</p>
  <p>“Then what difficulty remains?”</p>
  <p>“It is <i>this</i>, that I don’t believe he did it of
  his own free will. Now, supposing he did it
  <i>against</i> his will, merely to satisfy my scruples,
  would not his claim on me remain just as
  strong as ever? And would not my promise
  be as binding as ever? My father says
  ‘no’; but I ca’n’t help fearing he is biased
  by his love for me. And I’ve asked no one
  else. I have many friends—friends for the
  bright sunny weather; not friends for the
  clouds and storms of life; not <i>old</i> friends
  like you!”</p>
  <p>“Let me think a little,” I said: and for
  some minutes we walked on in silence, while,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
  pained to the heart at seeing the bitter trial
  that had come upon this pure and gentle soul,
  I strove in vain to see my way through the
  tangled skein of conflicting motives.</p>
  <p>“If she loves him truly,” (I seemed at last
  to grasp the clue to the problem) “is not <i>that</i>,
  for her, the voice of God? May she not hope
  that she is sent to him, even as Ananias was
  sent to Saul in his blindness, that he may receive
  his sight?” Once more I seemed to
  hear Arthur whispering “<i>What knowest thou,
  O wife, whether thou shalt save thy husband?</i>”
  and I broke the silence with the words “If
  you still love him truly——”</p>
  <p>“I do <i>not</i>!” she hastily interrupted. “At
  least—not in <i>that</i> way. I <i>believe</i> I loved him
  when I promised; but I was very young: it
  is hard to know. But, whatever the feeling
  was, it is dead <i>now</i>. The motive on <i>his</i> side
  is Love: on <i>mine</i> it is—Duty!”</p>
  <p>Again there was a long silence. The whole
  skein of thought was tangled worse than ever.
  This time <i>she</i> broke the silence. “Don’t misunderstand
  me!” she said. “When I said my
  heart was not <i>his</i>, I did not mean it was any
  <span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
  one else’s! At present I feel bound to <i>him</i>;
  and, till I know I am absolutely free, in the
  sight of God, to love any other than him,
  I’ll never even <i>think</i> of any one else—in
  <i>that</i> way, I mean. I would die sooner!” I
  had never imagined my gentle friend capable
  of such passionate utterances.</p>
  <p>I ventured on no further remark until we
  had nearly arrived at the Hall-gate; but, the
  longer I reflected, the clearer it became
  to me that no call of Duty demanded the
  sacrifice—possibly of the happiness of a life—which
  she seemed ready to make. I tried
  to make this clear to <i>her</i> also, adding some
  warnings on the dangers that surely awaited
  a union in which mutual love was wanting.
  “The only argument for it, worth considering,”
  I said in conclusion, “seems to be his
  supposed <i>reluctance</i> in releasing you from
  your promise. I have tried to give to that
  argument its <i>full</i> weight, and my conclusion
  is that it does <i>not</i> affect the rights of the
  case, or invalidate the release he has given
  you. My belief is that you are <i>entirely</i> free
  to act as <i>now</i> seems right.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
  <p>“I am <i>very</i> grateful to you,” she said
  earnestly. “Believe it, please! I ca’n’t put
  it into proper words!” and the subject was
  dropped by mutual consent: and I only
  learned, long afterwards, that our discussion
  had really served to dispel the doubts that
  had harassed her so long.</p>
  <p>We parted at the Hall-gate, and I found
  Arthur eagerly awaiting my arrival; and, before
  we parted for the night, I had heard the whole
  story—how he had put off his journey from
  day to day, feeling that he <i>could</i> not go away
  from the place till his fate had been irrevocably
  settled by the wedding taking place: how the
  preparations for the wedding, and the excitement
  in the neighbourhood, had suddenly come
  to an end, and he had learned (from Major
  Lindon, who called to wish him good-bye) that
  the engagement had been broken off by mutual
  consent: how he had instantly abandoned all
  his plans for going abroad, and had decided to
  stay on at Elveston, for a year or two at any
  rate, till his newly-awakened hopes should
  prove true or false; and how, since that
  memorable day, he had avoided all meetings
  <span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
  with Lady Muriel, fearing to betray his
  feelings before he had had any sufficient
  evidence as to how she regarded him. “But
  it is nearly six weeks since all that happened,”
  he said in conclusion, “and we can meet in the
  ordinary way, now, with no need for any painful
  allusions. I would have written to tell you all
  this: only I kept hoping from day to day,
  that—that there would be <i>more</i> to tell!”</p>
  <p>“And how should there be <i>more</i>, you foolish
  fellow,” I fondly urged, “if you never even go
  near her? Do you expect the offer to come
  from <i>her</i>?”</p>
  <p>Arthur was betrayed into a smile. “No,”
  he said, “I hardly expect <i>that</i>. But I’m a
  desperate coward. There’s no doubt about it!”</p>
  <p>“And what <i>reasons</i> have you heard of for
  breaking off the engagement?”</p>
  <p>“A good many,” Arthur replied, and proceeded
  to count them on his fingers. “First, it
  was found that she was dying of—something;
  so <i>he</i> broke it off. Then it was found that <i>he</i>
  was dying of—some other thing; so <i>she</i> broke
  it off. Then the Major turned out to be a
  confirmed gamester; so the <i>Earl</i> broke it off.
  <span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
  Then the Earl insulted him; so the <i>Major</i>
  broke it off. It got a good deal broken off, all
  things considered!”</p>
  <p>“You have all this on the very best authority,
  of course?”</p>
  <p>“Oh, certainly! And communicated in the
  strictest confidence! Whatever defects Elveston
  society suffers from, <i>want of information</i>
  isn’t one of them!”</p>
  <p>“Nor <i>reticence</i>, either, it seems. But, seriously,
  do you know the real reason?”</p>
  <p>“No, I’m quite in the dark.”</p>
  <p>I did not feel that I had any right to
  enlighten him; so I changed the subject, to the
  less engrossing one of “new milk,” and we
  agreed that I should walk over, next day, to
  Hunter’s farm, Arthur undertaking to set me
  part of the way, after which he had to return
  to keep a business-engagement.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
  <h2 id="c3">CHAPTER III.
  <br><span class="small">STREAKS OF DAWN.</span></h2>
  <p>Next day proved warm and sunny, and we
  started early, to enjoy the luxury of a good long
  chat before he would be obliged to leave me.</p>
  <p>“This neighbourhood has more than its due
  proportion of the <i>very</i> poor,” I remarked, as
  we passed a group of hovels, too dilapidated
  to deserve the name of “cottages.”</p>
  <p>“But the few rich,” Arthur replied, “give
  more than their due proportion of help in
  charity. So the balance is kept.”</p>
  <p>“I suppose the <i>Earl</i> does a good deal?”</p>
  <p>“He <i>gives</i> liberally; but he has not the
  health or strength to do more. Lady Muriel
  <span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
  does more in the way of school-teaching and
  cottage-visiting than she would like me to
  reveal.”</p>
  <p>“Then <i>she</i>, at least, is not one of the ‘idle
  mouths’ one so often meets with among the
  upper classes. I have sometimes thought they
  would have a hard time of it, if suddenly
  called on to give their <i>raison d’être</i>, and to
  show cause why they should be allowed to
  live any longer!”</p>
  <p>“The whole subject,” said Arthur, “of what
  we may call ‘idle mouths’ (I mean persons
  who absorb some of the material <i>wealth</i> of a
  community—in the form of food, clothes, and
  so on—without contributing its equivalent in
  the form of productive <i>labour</i>) is a complicated
  one, no doubt. I’ve tried to think it
  out. And it seemed to me that the simplest
  form of the problem, to start with, is a community
  without <i>money</i>, who buy and sell by
  <i>barter</i> only; and it makes it yet simpler to
  suppose the food and other things to be capable
  of <i>keeping</i> for many years without spoiling.”</p>
  <p>“Yours is an excellent plan,” I said. “What
  is your solution of the problem?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
  <p>“The commonest type of ‘idle mouths,’”
  said Arthur, “is no doubt due to money being
  left by parents to their own children. So I
  imagined a man—either exceptionally clever,
  or exceptionally strong and industrious—who
  had contributed so much valuable labour
  to the needs of the community that its equivalent,
  in clothes, &amp;c., was (say) five times as
  much as he needed for himself. We cannot
  deny his <i>absolute</i> right to give the superfluous
  wealth as he chooses. So, if he leaves <i>four</i>
  children behind him (say two sons and two
  daughters), with enough of all the necessaries
  of life to last them a life-time, I cannot see
  that the <i>community</i> is in any way wronged if
  they choose to do nothing in life but to ‘eat,
  drink, and be merry.’ Most certainly, the
  community could not fairly say, in reference to
  <i>them</i>, ‘<i>if a man will not work, neither let him
  eat</i>.’ Their reply would be crushing. ‘The
  labour has already been <i>done</i>, which is a fair
  equivalent for the food we are eating; and
  you have had the benefit of it. On what
  principle of justice can you demand <i>two</i> quotas
  of work for <i>one</i> quota of food?’”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
  <p>“Yet surely,” I said, “there is something
  wrong <i>somewhere</i>, if these four people are well
  able to do useful work, and if that work is
  actually <i>needed</i> by the community, and they
  elect to sit idle?”</p>
  <p>“I think there <i>is</i>,” said Arthur: “but it
  seems to me to arise from a Law of God—that
  every one shall do as much as he can
  to help others—and not from any <i>rights</i>, on
  the part of the community, to exact labour as
  an equivalent for food that has already been
  fairly earned.”</p>
  <p>“I suppose the <i>second</i> form of the problem
  is where the ‘idle mouths’ possess <i>money</i> instead
  of <i>material</i> wealth?”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” replied Arthur: “and I think the
  simplest case is that of <i>paper</i>-money. <i>Gold</i>
  is itself a form of material wealth; but a bank-note
  is merely a <i>promise</i> to hand over so
  much <i>material</i> wealth when called upon to do
  so. The father of these four ‘idle mouths,’
  had done (let us say) five thousand pounds’
  worth of useful work for the community. In
  return for this, the community had given him
  what amounted to a written promise to hand
  <span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
  over, whenever called upon to do so, five
  thousand pounds’ worth of food, &amp;c. Then,
  if he only uses <i>one</i> thousand pounds’ worth
  himself, and leaves the rest of the notes to his
  children, surely they have a full right to <i>present</i>
  these written promises, and to say ‘hand
  over the food, for which the equivalent labour
  has been already done.’ Now I think <i>this</i>
  case well worth stating, publicly and clearly.
  I should like to drive it into the heads of
  those Socialists who are priming our ignorant
  paupers with such sentiments as ‘Look at
  them bloated haristocrats! Doing not a stroke
  o’ work for theirselves, and living on the sweat
  of <i>our</i> brows!’ I should like to <i>force</i> them
  to see that the <i>money</i>, which those ‘haristocrats’
  are spending, represents so much labour
  <i>already done</i> for the community, and whose
  equivalent, in <i>material</i> wealth, is <i>due from
  the community</i>.”</p>
  <p>“Might not the Socialists reply ‘Much of
  this money does not represent <i>honest</i> labour
  <i>at all</i>. If you could trace it back, from owner
  to owner, though you might begin with several
  legitimate steps, such as gift, or bequeathing
  <span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
  by will, or ‘value received,’ you would soon
  reach an owner who had no moral right to
  it, but had got it by fraud or other crimes;
  and of course his successors in the line would
  have no better right to it than <i>he</i> had.”</p>
  <p>“No doubt, no doubt,” Arthur replied.
  “But surely that involves the logical fallacy
  of <i>proving too much</i>? It is <i>quite</i> as applicable
  to <i>material</i> wealth, as it is to <i>money</i>. If
  we once begin to go back beyond the fact
  that the <i>present</i> owner of certain property
  came by it honestly, and to ask whether any
  previous owner, in past ages, got it by fraud,
  would <i>any</i> property be secure?”</p>
  <p>After a minute’s thought, I felt obliged to
  admit the truth of this.</p>
  <p>“My general conclusion,” Arthur continued,
  “from the mere standpoint of human <i>rights</i>,
  man against man, was this—that if some
  wealthy ‘idle mouth,’ who has come by his
  money in a lawful way, even though not one
  atom of the labour it represents has been his
  own doing, chooses to spend it on his own
  needs, without contributing any labour to the
  community from whom he buys his food and
  <span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
  clothes, that community has no <i>right</i> to interfere
  with him. But it’s quite another thing,
  when we come to consider the <i>divine</i> law.
  Measured by <i>that</i> standard, such a man is
  undoubtedly doing wrong, if he fails to use,
  for the good of those in need, the strength
  or the skill, that God has given him. That
  strength and skill do <i>not</i> belong to the community,
  to be paid to <i>them</i> as a <i>debt</i>: they
  do <i>not</i> belong to the man <i>himself</i>, to be used
  for his <i>own</i> enjoyment: they <i>do</i> belong to God,
  to be used according to <i>His</i> will; and we are
  not left in doubt as to what that will is. ‘<i>Do
  good, and lend, hoping for nothing again.</i>’”</p>
  <p>“Anyhow,” I said, “an ‘idle mouth’ very
  often gives away a great deal in charity.”</p>
  <p>“In <i>so-called</i> ‘charity,’” he corrected me.
  “Excuse me if I seem to speak <i>un</i>charitably.
  I would not dream of <i>applying</i> the term to
  any <i>individual</i>. But I would say, <i>generally</i>,
  that a man who gratifies every fancy that
  occurs to him—denying himself in <i>nothing</i>—and
  merely gives to the poor some part, or
  even <i>all</i>, of his <i>superfluous</i> wealth, is only
  deceiving himself if he calls it <i>charity</i>.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
  <p>“But, even in giving away <i>superfluous</i>
  wealth, he <i>may</i> be denying himself the miser’s
  pleasure in hoarding?”</p>
  <p>“I grant you that, gladly,” said Arthur.
  “Given that he <i>has</i> that morbid craving, he
  is doing a good deed in restraining it.”</p>
  <p>“But, even in spending on <i>himself</i>,” I persisted,
  “our typical rich man often does good,
  by employing people who would otherwise be
  out of work: and that is often better than
  pauperising them by <i>giving</i> the money.”</p>
  <p>“I’m glad you’ve said that!” said Arthur.
  “I would not like to quit the subject without
  exposing the <i>two</i> fallacies of that statement—which
  have gone so long uncontradicted that
  Society now accepts it as an axiom!”</p>
  <p>“What are they?” I said. “I don’t even
  see <i>one</i>, myself.”</p>
  <p>“One is merely the fallacy of <i>ambiguity</i>—the
  assumption that ‘<i>doing good</i>’ (that is, benefiting
  somebody) is necessarily <i>a good thing to
  do</i> (that is, a <i>right</i> thing). The other is the
  assumption that, if one of two specified acts
  is <i>better</i> than another, it is necessarily a <i>good</i>
  act in itself. I should like to call this the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>
  fallacy of <i>comparison</i>—meaning that it assumes
  that what is <i>comparatively</i> good is
  therefore <i>positively</i> good.”</p>
  <p>“Then what is <i>your</i> test of a good act?”</p>
  <p>“That it shall be <i>our best</i>,” Arthur confidently
  replied. “And even <i>then</i> ‘<i>we are
  unprofitable servants</i>.’ But let me illustrate
  the two fallacies. Nothing illustrates a fallacy
  so well as an extreme case, which fairly
  comes under it. Suppose I find two children
  drowning in a pond. I rush in, and save one
  of the children, and then walk away, leaving
  the other to drown. Clearly I have ‘<i>done good</i>,’
  in saving a child’s life? But——. Again,
  supposing I meet an inoffensive stranger, and
  knock him down, and walk on. Clearly that
  is ‘<i>better</i>’ than if I had proceeded to jump
  upon him and break his ribs? But——”</p>
  <p>“Those ‘buts’ are quite unanswerable,” I
  said. “But I should like an instance from
  <i>real</i> life.”</p>
  <p>“Well, let us take one of those abominations
  of modern Society, a Charity-Bazaar.
  It’s an interesting question to think out—how
  much of the money, that reaches the object in
  <span class="pb" id="Page_45">45</span>
  view, is <i>genuine</i> charity; and whether even
  <i>that</i> is spent in the <i>best</i> way. But the subject
  needs regular classification, and analysis, to
  understand it properly.”</p>
  <p>“I should be glad to <i>have</i> it analysed,” I
  said: “it has often puzzled me.”</p>
  <p>“Well, if I am really not boring you. Let
  us suppose our Charity-Bazaar to have been
  organised to aid the funds of some Hospital:
  and that A, B, C <i>give</i> their services in making
  articles to sell, and in acting as salesmen,
  while X, Y, Z buy the articles, and the money
  so paid goes to the Hospital.</p>
  <p>“There are two distinct species of such
  Bazaars: one, where the payment exacted is
  merely the <i>market-value</i> of the goods supplied,
  that is, exactly what you would have to pay at
  a shop: the other, where <i>fancy-prices</i> are
  asked. We must take these separately.</p>
  <p>“First, the ‘market-value’ case. Here A,
  B, C are exactly in the same position as ordinary
  shopkeepers; the only difference being that
  they give the proceeds to the Hospital. Practically,
  they are <i>giving their skilled labour</i> for
  the benefit of the Hospital. This seems to
  <span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
  me to be genuine charity. And I don’t see
  how they could use it better. But X, Y, Z,
  are exactly in the same position as any
  ordinary purchasers of goods. To talk of
  ‘charity’ in connection with <i>their</i> share of the
  business, is sheer nonsense. Yet they are
  very likely to do so.</p>
  <p>“Secondly, the case of ‘fancy-prices.’ Here
  I think the simplest plan is to divide the payment
  into two parts, the ‘market-value’ and
  the excess over that. The ‘market-value’
  part is on the same footing as in the first case:
  the <i>excess</i> is all we have to consider. Well,
  A, B, C do not <i>earn</i> it; so we may put <i>them</i>
  out of the question: it is a <i>gift</i>, from X, Y, Z,
  to the Hospital. And my opinion is that it is
  not given in the best way: far better buy what
  they choose to <i>buy</i>, and give what they choose
  to <i>give</i>, as two <i>separate</i> transactions: then
  there is <i>some</i> chance that their motive in giving
  may be real charity, instead of a mixed
  motive—half charity, half self-pleasing. ‘The
  trail of the serpent is over it all.’ And <i>therefore</i>
  it is that I hold all such spurious
  ‘Charities’ in <i>utter</i> abomination!” He ended
  <span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
  with unusual energy, and savagely beheaded,
  with his stick, a tall thistle at the road-side,
  behind which I was startled to see Sylvie
  and Bruno standing. I caught at his arm,
  but too late to stop him. Whether the
  stick reached them, or not, I could not feel
  sure: at any rate they took not the smallest
  notice of it, but smiled gaily, and nodded to
  me; and I saw at once that they were only
  visible to <i>me</i>: the ‘eerie’ influence had not
  reached to <i>Arthur</i>.</p>
  <p>“Why did you try to save it?” he said.
  “<i>That’s</i> not the wheedling Secretary of a
  Charity-Bazaar! I only wish it were!” he
  added grimly.</p>
  <p>“Doos oo know, that stick went right froo
  my head!” said Bruno. (They had run round
  to me by this time, and each had secured a
  hand.) “Just under my chin! I <i>are</i> glad I
  aren’t a thistle!”</p>
  <p>“Well, we’ve threshed <i>that</i> subject out,
  anyhow!” Arthur resumed. “I’m afraid I’ve
  been talking too much, for <i>your</i> patience and
  for my strength. I must be turning soon.
  This is about the end of my tether.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“Take, O boatman, thrice thy fee;</p>
  <p class="t0">Take, I give it willingly;</p>
  <p class="t0">For, invisible to thee,</p>
  <p class="t0">Spirits twain have crossed with me!”</p>
  </div>
  <p>I quoted, involuntarily.</p>
  <p>“For utterly inappropriate and irrelevant
  quotations,” laughed Arthur, “you are ‘ekalled
  by few, and excelled by none’!” And we
  strolled on.</p>
  <p>As we passed the head of the lane that led
  down to the beach, I noticed a single figure,
  moving slowly along it, seawards. She was a
  good way off, and had her back to us: but it
  was Lady Muriel, unmistakably. Knowing
  that Arthur had not seen her, as he had been
  looking, in the other direction, at a gathering
  rain-cloud, I made no remark, but tried to
  think of some plausible pretext for sending
  him back by the sea.</p>
  <p>The opportunity instantly presented itself.
  “I’m getting tired,” he said. “I don’t think
  it would be prudent to go further. I had
  better turn here.”</p>
  <p>I turned with him, for a few steps, and as
  we again approached the head of the lane, I
  <span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
  said, as carelessly as I could, “Don’t go back
  by the road. It’s too hot and dusty. Down
  this lane, and along the beach, is nearly as
  short; and you’ll get a breeze off the sea.”</p>
  <p>“Yes, I think I will,” Arthur began; but at
  that moment we came into sight of Lady
  Muriel, and he checked himself. “No, it’s
  too far round. Yet it certainly <i>would</i> be
  cooler——” He stood, hesitating, looking
  first one way and then the other—a melancholy
  picture of utter infirmity of purpose!</p>
  <p>How long this humiliating scene would have
  continued, if <i>I</i> had been the only external
  influence, it is impossible to say; for at this
  moment Sylvie, with a swift decision worthy
  of Napoleon himself, took the matter into
  her own hands. “You go and drive <i>her</i>, up
  this way,” she said to Bruno. “I’ll get <i>him</i>
  along!” And she took hold of the stick that
  Arthur was carrying, and gently pulled him
  down the lane.</p>
  <p>He was totally unconscious that any will
  but his own was acting on the stick, and
  appeared to think it had taken a horizontal
  position simply because he was pointing with
  <span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
  it. “Are not those <i>orchises</i> under the hedge
  there?” he said. “I think that decides me.
  I’ll gather some as I go along.”</p>
  <div class="img" id="fig4">
  <img alt="‘ARE NOT THOSE ORCHISES?’" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i050.jpg" id="id-2120539436536684484" width="500" height="578">
  <p class="center small">‘ARE NOT THOSE ORCHISES?’</p>
  </div>
  <p>Meanwhile Bruno had run on beyond Lady
  Muriel, and, with much jumping about and shouting
  (shouts audible to no one but Sylvie and
  myself), much as if he were driving sheep, he
  managed to turn her round and make her
  <span class="pb" id="Page_51">51</span>
  walk, with eyes demurely cast upon the ground,
  in our direction.</p>
  <p>The victory was ours! And, since it was
  evident that the lovers, thus urged together,
  <i>must</i> meet in another minute, I turned and
  walked on, hoping that Sylvie and Bruno
  would follow my example, as I felt sure that
  the fewer the spectators the better it would be
  for Arthur and his good angel.</p>
  <p>“And what sort of meeting was it?” I
  wondered, as I paced dreamily on.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
  <h2 id="c4">CHAPTER IV.
  <br><span class="small">THE DOG-KING.</span></h2>
  <p>“They shooked hands,” said Bruno, who
  was trotting at my side, in answer to the unspoken
  question.</p>
  <p>“And they looked <i>ever</i> so pleased!” Sylvie
  added from the other side.</p>
  <p>“Well, we must get on, now, as quick as we
  can,” I said. “If only I knew the best way to
  Hunter’s farm!”</p>
  <p>“They’ll be sure to know in this cottage,”
  said Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“Yes, I suppose they will. Bruno, would
  you run in and ask?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
  <p>Sylvie stopped him, laughingly, as he ran off.
  “Wait a minute,” she said. “I must make you
  <i>visible</i> first, you know.”</p>
  <p>“And <i>audible</i> too, I suppose?” I said, as she
  took the jewel, that hung round her neck, and
  waved it over his head, and touched his eyes
  and lips with it.</p>
  <p>“Yes,” said Sylvie: “and <i>once</i>, do you know,
  I made him <i>audible</i>, and forgot to make him
  <i>visible</i>! And he went to buy some sweeties in
  a shop. And the man <i>was</i> so frightened! A
  voice seemed to come out of the air, ‘Please, I
  want two ounces of barley-sugar drops!’ And
  a shilling came <i>bang</i> down upon the counter!
  And the man said ‘I ca’n’t <i>see</i> you!’ And
  Bruno said ‘It doosn’t sinnify seeing <i>me</i>, so
  long as oo can see the <i>shilling</i>!’ But the man
  said he never sold barley-sugar drops to people
  he couldn’t <i>see</i>. So we had to—<i>Now</i>, Bruno,
  you’re ready!” And away he trotted.</p>
  <p>Sylvie spent the time, while we were waiting
  for him, in making <i>herself</i> visible also. “It’s
  rather awkward, you know,” she explained to
  me, “when we meet people, and they can see
  <i>one</i> of us, and ca’n’t see the <i>other</i>!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
  <p>In a minute or two Bruno returned, looking
  rather disconsolate. “He’d got friends with
  him, and he were <i>cross</i>!” he said. “He asked
  me who I were. And I said ‘I’m Bruno: who
  is <i>these</i> peoples?’ And he said ‘One’s my
  half-brother, and t’other’s my half-sister: and I
  don’t want no more company! Go along with
  yer!’ And I said ‘I ca’n’t go along <i>wizout</i>
  mine self!’ And I said ‘Oo shouldn’t have <i>bits</i>
  of peoples lying about like that! It’s welly
  untidy!’ And he said ‘Oh, don’t talk to <i>me</i>!’
  And he pushted me outside! And he shutted
  the door!”</p>
  <p>“And you never asked where Hunter’s farm
  was?” queried Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“Hadn’t room for any questions,” said
  Bruno. “The room were so crowded.”</p>
  <p>“Three people <i>couldn’t</i> crowd a room,” said
  Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“They <i>did</i>, though,” Bruno persisted. “<i>He</i>
  crowded it most. He’s such a welly <i>thick</i>
  man—so as oo couldn’t knock him down.”</p>
  <p>I failed to see the drift of Bruno’s argument.
  “Surely <i>anybody</i> could be knocked down,” I
  said: “thick or thin wouldn’t matter.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
  <p>“Oo couldn’t knock <i>him</i> down,” said Bruno.
  “He’s more wider than he’s high: so, when
  he’s lying down, he’s more higher than when
  he’s standing: so a-course oo couldn’t knock
  him <i>down</i>!”</p>
  <p>“Here’s another cottage,” I said: “<i>I’ll</i> ask
  the way, <i>this</i> time.”</p>
  <p>There was no need to go in, this time, as the
  woman was standing in the doorway, with a
  baby in her arms, talking to a respectably
  dressed man—a farmer, as I guessed—who
  seemed to be on his way to the town.</p>
  <p>“—and when there’s <i>drink</i> to be had,” he
  was saying, “he’s just the worst o’ the lot, is
  your Willie. So they tell me. He gets fairly
  mad wi’ it!”</p>
  <p>“I’d have given ’em the lie to their faces, a
  twelvemonth back!” the woman said in a
  broken voice. “But a’ canna noo! A’ canna
  noo!” She checked herself, on catching sight
  of us, and hastily retreated into the house,
  shutting the door after her.</p>
  <p>“Perhaps you can tell me where Hunter’s
  farm is?” I said to the man, as he turned away
  from the house.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
  <p>“I can <i>that</i>, Sir!” he replied with a smile.
  “I’m John Hunter hissel, at your sarvice.
  It’s nobbut half a mile further—the only
  house in sight, when you get round bend o’ the
  road yonder. You’ll find my good woman
  within, if so be you’ve business wi’ <i>her</i>. Or
  mebbe I’ll do as well?”</p>
  <p>“Thanks,” I said. “I want to order some
  milk. Perhaps I had better arrange it with
  your wife?”</p>
  <p>“Aye,” said the man. “<i>She</i> minds all <i>that</i>.
  Good day t’ye, Master—and to your bonnie
  childer, as well!” And he trudged on.</p>
  <p>“He should have said ‘<i>child</i>,’ not ‘<i>childer</i>’,”
  said Bruno. “Sylvie’s not a <i>childer</i>!”</p>
  <p>“He meant <i>both</i> of us,” said Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“No, he didn’t!” Bruno persisted. “’cause
  he said ‘bonnie’, oo know!”</p>
  <p>“Well, at any rate he <i>looked</i> at us both,”
  Sylvie maintained.</p>
  <p>“Well, then he <i>must</i> have seen we’re not
  <i>both</i> bonnie!” Bruno retorted. “A-<i>course</i> I’m
  much uglier than <i>oo</i>! Didn’t he mean <i>Sylvie</i>,
  Mister Sir?” he shouted over his shoulder, as
  he ran off.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
  <p>But there was no use in replying, as he had
  already vanished round the bend of the road.
  When we overtook him he was climbing a
  gate, and was gazing earnestly into the field,
  where a horse, a cow, and a kid were browsing
  amicably together. “For its father, a <i>Horse</i>,”
  he murmured to himself. “For its mother, a
  <i>Cow</i>. For their dear little child, a <i>little</i> Goat,
  is the most curiousest thing I ever seen in my
  world!”</p>
  <p>“Bruno’s World!” I pondered. “Yes, I
  suppose every child has a world of his own—and
  every man, too, for the matter of that.
  I wonder if <i>that’s</i> the cause for all the misunderstanding
  there is in Life?”</p>
  <p>“That <i>must</i> be Hunter’s farm!” said Sylvie,
  pointing to a house on the brow of the hill, led
  up to by a cart-road. “There’s no other farm
  in sight, <i>this</i> way; and you <i>said</i> we must be
  nearly there by this time.”</p>
  <p>I had <i>thought</i> it, while Bruno was climbing
  the gate, but I couldn’t remember having <i>said</i>
  it. However, Sylvie was evidently in the
  right. “Get down, Bruno,” I said, “and open
  the gate for us.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
  <p>“It’s a good thing we’s with oo, <i>isn’t</i> it,
  Mister Sir?” said Bruno, as we entered the
  field. “That big dog might have bited oo, if
  oo’d been alone! Oo needn’t be <i>flightened</i>
  of it!” he whispered, clinging tight to my hand
  to encourage me. “It aren’t fierce!”</p>
  <p>“Fierce!” Sylvie scornfully echoed, as the
  dog—a magnificent Newfoundland—that had
  come galloping down the field to meet us,
  began curveting round us, in gambols full of
  graceful beauty, and welcoming us with short
  joyful barks. “Fierce! Why, it’s as gentle
  as a lamb! It’s—why, Bruno, don’t you
  know it? It’s——”</p>
  <p>“So it <i>are</i>!” cried Bruno, rushing forwards
  and throwing his arms round its neck. “Oh,
  you <i>dear</i> dog!” And it seemed as if the two
  children would never have done hugging and
  stroking it.</p>
  <p>“And how <i>ever</i> did he get <i>here</i>?” said Bruno.
  “Ask him, Sylvie. I doosn’t know how.”</p>
  <p>And then began an eager talk in Doggee,
  which of course was lost upon <i>me</i>; and I could
  only <i>guess</i>, when the beautiful creature, with
  a sly glance at me, whispered something in
  <span class="pb" id="Page_59">59</span>
  Sylvie’s ear, that <i>I</i> was now the subject of conversation.
  Sylvie looked round laughingly.</p>
  <p>“He asked me who you are,” she explained.
  “And I said ‘He’s our <i>friend</i>.’ And he said
  ‘What’s his name?’ And I said ‘It’s <i>Mister
  Sir</i>.’ And he said ‘Bosh!’”</p>
  <p>“What is ‘Bosh!’ in Doggee?” I enquired.</p>
  <p>“It’s the same as in English,” said Sylvie.
  “Only, when a <i>dog</i> says it, it’s a sort of a
  whisper, that’s half a <i>cough</i> and half a <i>bark</i>.
  Nero, say ‘<i>Bosh!</i>’”</p>
  <p>And Nero, who had now begun gamboling
  round us again, said “<i>Bosh!</i>” several times;
  and I found that Sylvie’s description of the
  sound was perfectly accurate.</p>
  <p>“I wonder what’s behind this long wall?”
  I said, as we walked on.</p>
  <p>“It’s the <i>Orchard</i>,” Sylvie replied, after a
  consultation with Nero. “See, there’s a boy
  getting down off the wall, at that far corner.
  And now he’s running away across the field. I
  do believe he’s been stealing the apples!”</p>
  <p>Bruno set off after him, but returned to us in
  a few moments, as he had evidently no chance
  of overtaking the young rascal.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
  <p>“I couldn’t catch him!” he said. “I wiss
  I’d started a little sooner. His pockets <i>was</i>
  full of apples!”</p>
  <p>The Dog-King looked up at Sylvie, and
  said something in Doggee.</p>
  <p>“Why, of <i>course</i> you can!” Sylvie exclaimed.
  “How stupid not to think of it! <i>Nero</i>’ll hold
  him for us, Bruno! But I’d better make him
  invisible, first.” And she hastily got out the
  Magic Jewel, and began waving it over Nero’s
  head, and down along his back.</p>
  <p>“That’ll do!” cried Bruno, impatiently.
  “After him, good Doggie!”</p>
  <p>“Oh, Bruno!” Sylvie exclaimed reproachfully.
  “You shouldn’t have sent him off so
  quick! I hadn’t done the tail!”</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Nero was coursing like a greyhound
  down the field: so at least I concluded
  from all <i>I</i> could see of him—the long feathery
  tail, which floated like a meteor through the
  air—and in a very few seconds he had come
  up with the little thief.</p>
  <p>“He’s got him safe, by one foot!” cried
  Sylvie, who was eagerly watching the chase.
  “Now there’s no hurry, Bruno!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
  <p>So we walked, quite leisurely, down the
  field, to where the frightened lad stood. A
  more curious sight I had seldom seen, in all
  my ‘eerie’ experiences. Every bit of him was
  in violent action, except the left foot, which was
  apparently glued to the ground—there being
  nothing visibly holding it: while, at some little
  distance, the long feathery tail was waving
  gracefully from side to side, showing that Nero,
  at least, regarded the whole affair as nothing
  but a magnificent game of play.</p>
  <p>“What’s the matter with you?” I said, as
  gravely as I could.</p>
  <p>“Got the crahmp in me ahnkle!” the thief
  groaned in reply. “An’ me fut’s gone to
  sleep!” And he began to blubber aloud.</p>
  <p>“Now, look here!” Bruno said in a commanding
  tone, getting in front of him. “Oo’ve
  got to give up those apples!”</p>
  <p>The lad glanced at me, but didn’t seem
  to reckon <i>my</i> interference as worth anything.
  Then he glanced at Sylvie: <i>she</i> clearly didn’t
  count for very much, either. Then he took
  courage. “It’ll take a better man than any of
  <i>yer</i> to get ’em!” he retorted defiantly.</p>

  <p>Sylvie stooped and patted the invisible Nero.
  “A <i>little</i> tighter!” she whispered. And a sharp
  yell from the ragged boy showed how promptly
  the Dog-King had taken the hint.</p>
  <p>“What’s the matter <i>now</i>?” I said. “Is
  your ankle worse?”</p>
  <p>“And it’ll get worse, and worse, and worse,”
  Bruno solemnly assured him, “till oo gives
  up those apples!”</p>
  <p>Apparently the thief was convinced of this
  at last, and he sulkily began emptying his
  pockets of the apples. The children watched
  from a little distance, Bruno dancing with
  delight at every fresh yell extracted from
  Nero’s terrified prisoner.</p>
  <p>“That’s all,” the boy said at last.</p>
  <p>“It <i>isn’t</i> all!” cried Bruno. “There’s three
  more in that pocket!”</p>
  <p>Another hint from Sylvie to the Dog-King—another
  sharp yell from the thief, now
  convicted of lying also—and the remaining
  three apples were surrendered.</p>
  <p>“Let him go, please,” Sylvie said in Doggee,
  and the lad limped away at a great pace,
  stooping now and then to rub the ailing ankle,
  in fear, seemingly, that the ‘crahmp’ might
  attack it again.</p>

  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
  <p>Bruno ran back, with his booty, to the
  orchard wall, and pitched the apples over it
  one by one. “I’s welly afraid <i>some</i> of them’s
  gone under the wrong trees!” he panted, on
  overtaking us again.</p>
  <p>“The <i>wrong</i> trees!” laughed Sylvie. “Trees
  <i>ca’n’t</i> do wrong! There’s no such things as
  <i>wrong</i> trees!”</p>
  <p>“Then there’s no such things as <i>right</i>
  trees, neither!” cried Bruno. And Sylvie gave
  up the point.</p>
  <p>“Wait a minute, please!” she said to me.
  “I must make Nero <i>visible</i>, you know!”</p>
  <p>“No, <i>please</i> don’t!” cried Bruno, who had
  by this time mounted on the Royal back, and
  was twisting the Royal hair into a bridle.
  “It’ll be <i>such</i> fun to have him like this!”</p>
  <p>“Well, it <i>does</i> look funny,” Sylvie admitted,
  and led the way to the farm-house, where the
  farmer’s wife stood, evidently much perplexed
  at the weird procession now approaching her.
  “It’s summat gone wrong wi’ my spectacles,
  I doubt!” she murmured, as she took them
  <span class="pb" id="Page_66">66</span>
  off, and began diligently rubbing them with a
  corner of her apron.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile Sylvie had hastily pulled Bruno
  down from his steed, and had just time to make
  His Majesty wholly visible before the spectacles
  were resumed.</p>
  <p>All was natural, now; but the good woman
  still looked a little uneasy about it. “My
  eyesight’s getting bad,” she said, “but I see
  you <i>now</i>, my darlings! You’ll give me a kiss,
  wo’n’t you?”</p>
  <p>Bruno got behind me, in a moment: however
  Sylvie put up <i>her</i> face, to be kissed, as representative
  of <i>both</i>, and we all went in together.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
  <h2 id="c5">CHAPTER V.
  <br><span class="small">MATILDA JANE.</span></h2>
  <p>“Come to me, my little gentleman,” said
  our hostess, lifting Bruno into her lap, “and
  tell me everything.”</p>
  <p>“I ca’n’t,” said Bruno. “There wouldn’t be
  time. Besides, I don’t <i>know</i> everything.”</p>
  <p>The good woman looked a little puzzled,
  and turned to Sylvie for help. “Does he like
  <i>riding</i>?” she asked.</p>
  <p>“Yes, I <i>think</i> so,” Sylvie gently replied.
  “He’s just had a ride on <i>Nero</i>.”</p>
  <p>“Ah, Nero’s a grand dog, isn’t he? Were
  you ever outside a <i>horse</i>, my little man?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
  <p>“<i>Always!</i>” Bruno said with great decision.
  “Never was <i>inside</i> one. Was <i>oo</i>?”</p>
  <p>Here I thought it well to interpose, and to
  mention the business on which we had come,
  and so relieved her, for a few minutes, from
  Bruno’s perplexing questions.</p>
  <p>“And those dear children will like a bit of
  cake, <i>I’ll</i> warrant!” said the farmer’s hospitable
  wife, when the business was concluded, as she
  opened her cupboard, and brought out a cake.
  “And don’t you waste the crust, little gentleman!”
  she added, as she handed a good slice
  of it to Bruno. “You know what the poetry-book
  says about wilful waste?”</p>
  <p>“No, I don’t,” said Bruno. “What doos he
  say about it?”</p>
  <p>“Tell him, Bessie!” And the mother looked
  down, proudly and lovingly, on a rosy little
  maiden, who had just crept shyly into the room,
  and was leaning against her knee. “What’s
  that your poetry-book says about wilful waste?”</p>
  <p>“<i>For wilful waste makes woeful want</i>,” Bessie
  recited, in an almost inaudible whisper: “<i>and you
  may live to say ‘How much I wish I had the
  crust that then I threw away!’</i>”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
  <p>“Now try if <i>you</i> can say it, my dear! <i>For
  wilful</i>——”</p>
  <p>“<i>For wifful</i>—sumfinoruvver—” Bruno began,
  readily enough; and then there came a
  dead pause. “Ca’n’t remember no more!”</p>
  <p>“Well, what do you <i>learn</i> from it, then? You
  can tell us <i>that</i>, at any rate?”</p>
  <p>Bruno ate a little more cake, and considered:
  but the moral did not seem to him to be a very
  obvious one.</p>
  <p>“Always to——” Sylvie prompted him in
  a whisper.</p>
  <p>“Always to——” Bruno softly repeated: and
  then, with sudden inspiration, “always to look
  where it goes to!”</p>
  <p>“Where <i>what</i> goes to, darling?”</p>
  <p>“Why the <i>crust</i>, a course!” said Bruno.
  “Then, if I lived to say ‘<i>How much I wiss
  I had the crust</i>—’ (and all that), I’d know
  where I frew it to!”</p>
  <p>This new interpretation quite puzzled the
  good woman. She returned to the subject of
  ‘Bessie.’ “Wouldn’t you like to see Bessie’s
  doll, my dears! Bessie, take the little lady and
  gentleman to see Matilda Jane!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
  <p>Bessie’s shyness thawed away in a moment.
  “Matilda Jane has just woke up,” she stated,
  confidentially, to Sylvie. “Wo’n’t you help
  me on with her frock? Them strings <i>is</i> such
  a bother to tie!”</p>
  <p>“I can tie <i>strings</i>,” we heard, in Sylvie’s
  gentle voice, as the two little girls left the room
  together. Bruno ignored the whole proceeding,
  and strolled to the window, quite with the air of
  a fashionable gentleman. Little girls, and dolls,
  were not at all in his line.</p>
  <p>And forthwith the fond mother proceeded to
  tell me (as what mother is not ready to do?)
  of all Bessie’s virtues (and vices too, for the
  matter of that) and of the many fearful maladies
  which, notwithstanding those ruddy cheeks and
  that plump little figure, had nearly, time and
  again, swept her from the face of the earth.</p>
  <p>When the full stream of loving memories had
  nearly run itself out, I began to question her
  about the working men of that neighbourhood,
  and specially the ‘Willie,’ whom we had heard
  of at his cottage. “He was a good fellow
  once,” said my kind hostess: “but it’s the drink
  has ruined him! Not that I’d rob them of the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
  drink—it’s good for the most of them—but
  there’s some as is too weak to stand
  agin’ temptations: it’s a thousand pities, for
  <i>them</i>, as they ever built the Golden Lion at
  the corner there!”</p>
  <p>“The Golden Lion?” I repeated.</p>
  <p>“It’s the new Public,” my hostess explained.
  “And it stands right in the way, and handy
  for the workmen, as they come back from the
  brickfields, as it might be to-day, with their
  week’s wages. A deal of money gets wasted
  that way. And some of ’em gets drunk.”</p>
  <p>“If only they could have it in their own
  houses—” I mused, hardly knowing I had said
  the words out loud.</p>
  <p>“That’s it!” she eagerly exclaimed. It was
  evidently a solution, of the problem, that she
  had already thought out. “If only you could
  manage, so’s each man to have his own little
  barrel in his own house—there’d hardly be
  a drunken man in the length and breadth of
  the land!”</p>
  <p>And then I told her the old story—about
  a certain cottager who bought himself a little
  barrel of beer, and installed his wife as bar-keeper:
  <span class="pb" id="Page_72">72</span>
  and how, every time he wanted his
  mug of beer, he regularly paid her over the
  counter for it: and how she never would let
  him go on ‘tick,’ and was a perfectly inflexible
  bar-keeper in never letting him have more than
  his proper allowance: and how, every time the
  barrel needed refilling, she had plenty to do it
  with, and something over for her money-box:
  and how, at the end of the year, he not
  only found himself in first-rate health and spirits,
  with that undefinable but quite unmistakeable
  air which always distinguishes the sober man
  from the one who takes ‘a drop too much,’ but
  had quite a box full of money, all saved out of
  his own pence!</p>
  <p>“If only they’d all do like that!” said the
  good woman, wiping her eyes, which were overflowing
  with kindly sympathy. “Drink hadn’t
  need to be the curse it is to some——”</p>
  <p>“Only a <i>curse</i>,” I said, “when it is used
  wrongly. Any of God’s gifts may be turned
  into a curse, unless we use it wisely. But
  we must be getting home. Would you call the
  little girls? Matilda Jane has seen enough
  of company, for <i>one</i> day, I’m sure!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
  <p>“I’ll find ’em in a minute,” said my hostess,
  as she rose to leave the room. “Maybe that
  young gentleman saw which way they went?”</p>
  <p>“Where are they, Bruno?” I said.</p>
  <p>“They ain’t in the field,” was Bruno’s rather
  evasive reply, “’cause there’s nothing but <i>pigs</i>
  there, and Sylvie isn’t a pig. Now don’t
  imperrupt me any more, ’cause I’m telling a
  story to this fly; and it won’t attend!”</p>
  <p>“They’re among the apples, I’ll warrant
  ’em!” said the Farmer’s wife. So we left
  Bruno to finish his story, and went out into the
  orchard, where we soon came upon the children,
  walking sedately side by side, Sylvie carrying
  the doll, while little Bess carefully shaded its
  face, with a large cabbage-leaf for a parasol.</p>
  <p>As soon as they caught sight of us, little Bess
  dropped her cabbage-leaf and came running to
  meet us, Sylvie following more slowly, as her
  precious charge evidently needed great care
  and attention.</p>
  <p>“I’m its Mamma, and Sylvie’s the Head-Nurse,”
  Bessie explained: “and Sylvie’s taught
  me ever such a pretty song, for me to sing to
  Matilda Jane!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
  <p>“Let’s hear it once more, Sylvie,” I said,
  delighted at getting the chance I had long
  wished for, of hearing her sing. But Sylvie
  turned shy and frightened in a moment. “No,
  <i>please</i> not!” she said, in an earnest ‘aside’ to
  me. “Bessie knows it quite perfect now.
  Bessie can sing it!”</p>
  <p>“Aye, aye! Let Bessie sing it!” said the
  proud mother. “Bessie has a bonny voice of
  her own,” (this again was an ‘aside’ to me)
  “though I say it as shouldn’t!”</p>
  <p>Bessie was only too happy to accept the
  ‘encore.’ So the plump little Mamma sat
  down at our feet, with her hideous daughter
  reclining stiffly across her lap (it was one of
  a kind that wo’n’t sit down, under <i>any</i> amount
  of persuasion), and, with a face simply beaming
  with delight, began the lullaby, in a shout that
  <i>ought</i> to have frightened the poor baby into fits.
  The Head-Nurse crouched down behind her,
  keeping herself respectfully in the back-ground,
  with her hands on the shoulders of her little
  mistress, so as to be ready to act as Prompter,
  if required, and to supply ‘<i>each gap in faithless
  memory void</i>.’</p>

  <p class="center small">BESSIE’S SONG</p>
  </div>
  <p>The shout, with which she began, proved to
  be only a momentary effort. After a very few
  notes, Bessie toned down, and sang on in a
  small but very sweet voice. At first her great
  black eyes were fixed on her mother, but soon
  her gaze wandered upwards, among the apples,
  and she seemed to have quite forgotten that
  she had any other audience than her Baby, and
  her Head-Nurse, who once or twice supplied,
  almost inaudibly, the right note, when the singer
  was getting a little ‘flat.’</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“Matilda Jane, you never look</p>
  <p class="t0">At any toy or picture-book:</p>
  <p class="t0">I show you pretty things in vain—</p>
  <p class="t0">You must be blind, Matilda Jane!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“I ask you riddles, tell you tales,</p>
  <p class="t0">But <span class="norm">all</span> our conversation fails:</p>
  <p class="t0">You <span class="norm">never</span> answer me again—</p>
  <p class="t0">I fear you’re dumb, Matilda Jane!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“Matilda, darling, when I call,</p>
  <p class="t0">You never seem to hear at all:</p>
  <p class="t0">I shout with all my might and main—</p>
  <p class="t0">But you’re <span class="norm">so</span> deaf, Matilda Jane!</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“Matilda Jane, you needn’t mind;</p>
  <p class="t0">For, though you’re deaf, and dumb, and blind,</p>
  <p class="t0">There’s <span class="norm">some one</span> loves you, it is plain—</p>
  <p class="t0">And that is <span class="norm">me,</span> Matilda Jane!”</p>
  </div>
  <p>She sang three of the verses in a rather perfunctory
  style, but the last stanza evidently
  excited the little maiden. Her voice rose, ever
  clearer and louder: she had a rapt look on her
  face, as if suddenly inspired, and, as she sang
  the last few words, she clasped to her heart
  the inattentive Matilda Jane.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
  <p>“Kiss it now!” prompted the Head-Nurse.
  And in a moment the simpering meaningless
  face of the Baby was covered with a shower
  of passionate kisses.</p>
  <p>“What a bonny song!” cried the Farmer’s
  wife. “Who made the words, dearie?”</p>
  <p>“I—I think I’ll look for Bruno,” Sylvie
  said demurely, and left us hastily. The curious
  child seemed always afraid of being praised, or
  even noticed.</p>
  <p>“Sylvie planned the words,” Bessie informed
  us, proud of her superior information: “and
  Bruno planned the music—and <i>I</i> sang it!”
  (this last circumstance, by the way, we did not
  need to be told).</p>
  <p>So we followed Sylvie, and all entered the
  parlour together. Bruno was still standing at
  the window, with his elbows on the sill. He
  had, apparently, finished the story that he was
  telling to the fly, and had found a new
  occupation. “Don’t imperrupt!” he said as
  we came in. “I’m counting the Pigs in the
  field!”</p>
  <p>“How many are there?” I enquired.</p>
  <p>“About a thousand and four,” said Bruno.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
  <p>“You mean ‘about a thousand,’” Sylvie
  corrected him. “There’s no good saying ‘<i>and
  four</i>’: you <i>ca’n’t</i> be sure about the four!”</p>
  <p>“And you’re as wrong as ever!” Bruno
  exclaimed triumphantly. “It’s just the <i>four</i> I
  <i>can</i> be sure about; ’cause they’re here, grubbling
  under the window! It’s the <i>thousand</i>
  I isn’t pruffickly sure about!”</p>
  <p>“But some of them have gone into the
  sty,” Sylvie said, leaning over him to look out
  of the window.</p>
  <p>“Yes,” said Bruno; “but they went so slowly
  and so fewly, I didn’t care to count <i>them</i>.”</p>
  <p>“We must be going, children,” I said.
  “Wish Bessie good-bye.” Sylvie flung her
  arms round the little maiden’s neck, and kissed
  her: but Bruno stood aloof, looking unusually
  shy. (“I never kiss <i>nobody</i> but Sylvie!” he
  explained to me afterwards.) The farmer’s
  wife showed us out: and we were soon on our
  way back to Elveston.</p>
  <p>“And that’s the new public-house that we
  were talking about, I suppose?” I said, as
  we came in sight of a long low building, with
  the words ‘<span class="sc">The Golden Lion</span>’ over the door.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
  <p>“Yes, that’s it,” said Sylvie. “I wonder if
  <i>her</i> Willie’s inside? Run in, Bruno, and see
  if he’s there.”</p>
  <p>I interposed, feeling that Bruno was, in a
  sort of way, in <i>my</i> care. “That’s not a place
  to send a child into.” For already the revelers
  were getting noisy: and a wild discord of
  singing, shouting, and meaningless laughter
  came to us through the open windows.</p>
  <p>“They wo’n’t <i>see</i> him, you know,” Sylvie
  explained. “Wait a minute, Bruno!” She
  clasped the jewel, that always hung round her
  neck, between the palms of her hands, and
  muttered a few words to herself. What they
  were I could not at all make out, but some
  mysterious change seemed instantly to pass
  over us. My feet seemed to me no longer to
  press the ground, and the dream-like feeling
  came upon me, that I was suddenly endowed
  with the power of floating in the air. I could
  still just <i>see</i> the children: but their forms were
  shadowy and unsubstantial, and their voices
  sounded as if they came from some distant
  place and time, they were so unreal. However,
  I offered no further opposition to Bruno’s
  <span class="pb" id="Page_80">80</span>
  going into the house. He was back again in
  a few moments. “No, he isn’t come yet,” he
  said. “They’re talking about him inside, and
  saying how drunk he was last week.”</p>
  <p>While he was speaking, one of the men
  lounged out through the door, a pipe in one
  hand and a mug of beer in the other, and
  crossed to where we were standing, so as to
  get a better view along the road. Two or
  three others leaned out through the open
  window, each holding his mug of beer, with
  red faces and sleepy eyes. “Canst see him,
  lad?” one of them asked.</p>
  <p>“I dunnot know,” the man said, taking a
  step forwards, which brought us nearly face
  to face. Sylvie hastily pulled me out of his
  way. “Thanks, child,” I said. “I had forgotten
  he couldn’t see us. What would have
  happened if I had staid in his way?”</p>
  <p>“I don’t know,” Sylvie said gravely. “It
  wouldn’t matter to <i>us</i>; but <i>you</i> may be different.”
  She said this in her usual voice, but
  the man took no sort of notice, though she
  was standing close in front of him, and looking
  up into his face as she spoke.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
  <p>“He’s coming now!” cried Bruno, pointing
  down the road.</p>
  <p>“He be a-coomin noo!” echoed the man,
  stretching out his arm exactly over Bruno’s
  head, and pointing with his pipe.</p>
  <p>“Then <i>chorus</i> agin!” was shouted out by
  one of the red-faced men in the window: and
  forthwith a dozen voices yelled, to a harsh
  discordant melody, the refrain:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“There’s him, an’ yo’ an’ me,</p>
  <p class="t5">Roarin’ laddies!</p>
  <p class="t0">We loves a bit o spree,</p>
  <p class="t0">Roarin’ laddies we,</p>
  <p class="t5">Roarin’ laddies</p>
  <p class="t5">Roarin’ laddies!”</p>
  </div>
  <p>The man lounged back again to the house,
  joining lustily in the chorus as he went: so
  that only the children and I were in the road
  when ‘Willie’ came up.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
  <h2 id="c6">CHAPTER VI.
  <br><span class="small">WILLIE’S WIFE.</span></h2>
  <p>He made for the door of the public-house,
  but the children intercepted him. Sylvie clung
  to one arm; while Bruno, on the opposite
  side, was pushing him with all his strength,
  with many inarticulate cries of “Gee-up! Gee-back!
  Woah then!” which he had picked up
  from the waggoners.</p>
  <p>‘Willie’ took not the least notice of them:
  he was simply conscious that <i>something</i> had
  checked him: and, for want of any other way
  of accounting for it, he seemed to regard it
  as his own act.</p>

  <p class="center small">THE RESCUE OF WILLIE</p>
  </div>
  <p>“I wunnut coom in,” he said: “not to-day.”</p>
  <p>“A mug o’ beer wunnut hurt ’ee!” his
  friends shouted in chorus. “<i>Two</i> mugs wunnut
  hurt ’ee! Nor a dozen mugs!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
  <p>“Nay,” said Willie. “I’m agoan whoam.”</p>
  <p>“What, withouten thy drink, Willie man?”
  shouted the others. But ‘Willie man’ would
  have no more discussion, and turned doggedly
  away, the children keeping one on each side of
  him, to guard him against any change in his
  sudden resolution.</p>
  <p>For a while he walked on stoutly enough,
  keeping his hands in his pockets, and softly
  whistling a tune, in time to his heavy tread:
  his success, in appearing entirely at his ease,
  was <i>almost</i> complete; but a careful observer
  would have noted that he had forgotten the
  second part of the air, and that, when it broke
  down, he instantly began it again, being too
  nervous to think of another, and too restless
  to endure silence.</p>
  <p>It was not the old fear that possessed him
  now—the old fear, that had been his dreary
  companion every Saturday night he could remember,
  as he had reeled along, steadying
  himself against gates and garden-palings, and
  when the shrill reproaches of his wife had
  seemed to his dazed brain only the echo of a
  yet more piercing voice within, the intolerable
  <span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
  wail of a hopeless remorse: it was a wholly
  new fear that had come to him now: life had
  taken on itself a new set of colours, and was
  lighted up with a new and dazzling radiance,
  and he did not see, as yet, how his home-life,
  and his wife and child, would fit into the new
  order of things: the very novelty of it all was,
  to his simple mind, a perplexity and an overwhelming
  terror.</p>
  <p>And now the tune died into sudden silence
  on the trembling lips, as he turned a sharp
  corner, and came in sight of his own cottage,
  where his wife stood, leaning with folded arms
  on the wicket-gate, and looking up the road
  with a pale face, that had in it no glimmer of
  the light of hope—only the heavy shadow of
  a deep stony despair.</p>
  <p>“Fine an’ early, lad! Fine an’ early!” The
  words might have been words of welcoming,
  but oh, the bitterness of the tone in which she
  said it! “What brings thee from thy merry
  mates, and all the fiddling and the jigging?
  Pockets empty, I doubt? Or thou’st come,
  mebbe, for to see thy little one die? The
  bairnie’s clemmed, and I’ve nor bite nor sup
  <span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
  to gie her. But what does <i>thou</i> care?” She
  flung the gate open, and met him with blazing
  eyes of fury.</p>
  <p>The man said no word. Slowly, and with
  downcast eyes, he passed into the house, while
  she, half terrified at his strange silence, followed
  him in without another word; and it was not
  till he had sunk into a chair, with his arms
  crossed on the table and with drooping head,
  that she found her voice again.</p>
  <p>It seemed entirely natural for us to go in
  with them: at another time one would have
  asked leave for this, but I felt, I knew not
  why, that we were in some mysterious way
  invisible, and as free to come and to go as
  disembodied spirits.</p>
  <p>The child in the cradle woke up, and raised
  a piteous cry, which in a moment brought the
  children to its side: Bruno rocked the cradle,
  while Sylvie tenderly replaced the little head on
  the pillow from which it had slipped. But the
  mother took no heed of the cry, nor yet of the
  satisfied ‘coo’ that it set up when Sylvie had
  made it happy again: she only stood gazing at
  her husband, and vainly trying, with white
  <span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
  quivering lips (I believe she thought he was
  mad), to speak in the old tones of shrill upbraiding
  that he knew so well.</p>
  <p>“And thou’st spent all thy wages—I’ll
  swear thou hast—on the devil’s own drink—and
  thou’st been and made thysen a beast
  again—as thou allus dost——”</p>
  <p>“Hasna!” the man muttered, his voice hardly
  rising above a whisper, as he slowly emptied
  his pockets on the table. “There’s th’ wage,
  Missus, every penny on’t.”</p>
  <p>The woman gasped, and put one hand to her
  heart, as if under some great shock of surprise.
  “Then <i>how</i>’s thee gotten th’ drink?”</p>
  <p>“<i>Hasna</i> gotten it,” he answered her, in a
  tone more sad than sullen. “I hanna touched
  a drop this blessed day. No!” he cried aloud,
  bringing his clenched fist heavily down upon
  the table, and looking up at her with gleaming
  eyes, “nor I’ll never touch another drop o’ the
  cursed drink—till I die—so help me God
  my Maker!” His voice, which had suddenly
  risen to a hoarse shout, dropped again as
  suddenly: and once more he bowed his head,
  and buried his face in his folded arms.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>

  <p class="center small">WILLIE’S WIFE</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
  <p>The woman had dropped upon her knees by
  the cradle, while he was speaking. She neither
  looked at him nor seemed to hear him. With
  hands clasped above her head, she rocked herself
  wildly to and fro. “Oh my God! Oh my
  God!” was all she said, over and over again.</p>
  <p>Sylvie and Bruno gently unclasped her hands
  and drew them down—till she had an arm
  round each of them, though she took no notice
  of them, but knelt on with eyes gazing upwards,
  and lips that moved as if in silent thanksgiving.
  The man kept his face hidden, and uttered no
  sound: but one could <i>see</i> the sobs that shook
  him from head to foot.</p>
  <p>After a while he raised his head—his face
  all wet with tears. “Polly!” he said softly;
  and then, louder, “Old Poll!”</p>
  <p>Then she rose from her knees and came to
  him, with a dazed look, as if she were walking
  in her sleep. “Who was it called me
  old Poll?” she asked: her voice took on it a
  tender playfulness: her eyes sparkled; and
  the rosy light of Youth flushed her pale cheeks,
  till she looked more like a happy girl of seventeen
  than a worn woman of forty. “Was
  <span class="pb" id="Page_90">90</span>
  that my own lad, my Willie, a-waiting for me
  at the stile?”</p>
  <p>His face too was transformed, in the same
  magic light, to the likeness of a bashful boy:
  and boy and girl they seemed, as he wound
  an arm about her, and drew her to his side,
  while with the other hand he thrust from him
  the heap of money, as though it were something
  hateful to the touch. “Tak it, lass,” he said,
  “tak it all! An’ fetch us summat to eat: but
  get a sup o’ milk, first, for t’ bairn.”</p>
  <p>“My <i>little</i> bairn!” she murmured as she
  gathered up the coins. “My own little lassie!”
  Then she moved to the door, and was passing
  out, but a sudden thought seemed to arrest
  her: she hastily returned—first to kneel down
  and kiss the sleeping child, and then to throw
  herself into her husband’s arms and be strained
  to his heart. The next moment she was on
  her way, taking with her a jug that hung on
  a peg near the door: we followed close behind.</p>
  <p>We had not gone far before we came in sight
  of a swinging sign-board bearing the word
  ‘<span class="small">DAIRY</span>’ on it, and here she went in, welcomed
  by a little curly white dog, who, not being
  <span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
  under the ‘eerie’ influence, saw the children,
  and received them with the most effusive affection.
  When I got inside, the dairyman was in
  the act of taking the money. “Is’t for thysen,
  Missus, or for t’ bairn?” he asked, when he had
  filled the jug, pausing with it in his hand.</p>
  <p>“For t’ <i>bairn</i>!” she said, almost reproachfully.
  “Think’st tha I’d touch a drop <i>mysen</i>,
  while as <i>she</i> hadna got her fill?”</p>
  <p>“All right, Missus,” the man replied, turning
  away with the jug in his hand. “Let’s just
  mak sure it’s good measure.” He went back
  among his shelves of milk-bowls, carefully keeping
  his back towards her while he emptied a
  little measure of cream into the jug, muttering
  to himself “mebbe it’ll hearten her up a bit,
  the little lassie!”</p>
  <p>The woman never noticed the kind deed,
  but took back the jug with a simple “Good
  evening, Master,” and went her way: but the
  children had been more observant, and, as
  we followed her out, Bruno remarked “That
  were <i>welly</i> kind: and I loves that man: and
  if I was welly rich I’d give him a hundred
  pounds—and a bun. That little grummeling
  <span class="pb" id="Page_92">92</span>
  dog doosn’t know its business!” He referred
  to the dairyman’s little dog, who had apparently
  quite forgotten the affectionate welcome he had
  given us on our arrival, and was now following
  at a respectful distance, doing his best to
  ‘<i>speed the parting guest</i>’ with a shower of
  little shrill barks, that seemed to tread on one
  another’s heels.</p>
  <p>“What <i>is</i> a dog’s business?” laughed Sylvie.
  “Dogs ca’n’t keep shops and give change!”</p>
  <p>“Sisters’ businesses <i>isn’t</i> to laugh at their
  brothers,” Bruno replied with perfect gravity.
  “And dogs’ businesses is to <i>bark</i>—not like
  that: it should finish one bark before it begins
  another: and it should—Oh Sylvie, there’s
  some dindledums!”</p>
  <p>And in another moment the happy children
  were flying across the common, racing for the
  patch of dandelions.</p>
  <p>While I stood watching them, a strange
  dreamy feeling came upon me: a railway-platform
  seemed to take the place of the green
  sward, and, instead of the light figure of Sylvie
  bounding along, I seemed to see the flying
  form of Lady Muriel; but whether Bruno
  <span class="pb" id="Page_93">93</span>
  had also undergone a transformation, and had
  become the old man whom she was running to
  overtake, I was unable to judge, so instantaneously
  did the feeling come and go.</p>
  <p>When I re-entered the little sitting-room
  which I shared with Arthur, he was standing
  with his back to me, looking out of the open
  window, and evidently had not heard me enter.
  A cup of tea, apparently just tasted and pushed
  aside, stood on the table, on the opposite side of
  which was a letter, just begun, with the pen
  lying across it: an open book lay on the sofa:
  the London paper occupied the easy chair; and
  on the little table, which stood by it, I noticed
  an unlighted cigar and an open box of cigar-lights:
  all things betokened that the Doctor,
  usually so methodical and so self-contained, had
  been trying every form of occupation, and could
  settle to none!</p>
  <p>“This is very unlike <i>you</i>, Doctor!” I was
  beginning, but checked myself, as he turned at
  the sound of my voice, in sheer amazement at
  the wonderful change that had taken place in
  his appearance. Never had I seen a face so
  radiant with happiness, or eyes that sparkled
  <span class="pb" id="Page_94">94</span>
  with such unearthly light! “Even thus,” I
  thought, “must the herald-angel have looked,
  who brought to the shepherds, watching over
  their flocks by night, that sweet message of
  ‘<i>peace on earth, good-will to men</i>’!”</p>
  <p>“Yes, dear friend!” he said, as if in answer
  to the question that I suppose he read in my
  face. “It is true! It is true!”</p>
  <p>No need to ask <i>what</i> was true. “God bless
  you both!” I said, as I felt the happy tears
  brimming to my eyes. “You were made for
  each other!”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” he said, simply, “I believe we were.
  And <i>what</i> a change it makes in one’s Life!
  This isn’t the same world! That isn’t the sky
  I saw yesterday! Those clouds—I never
  saw such clouds in all my life before! They
  look like troops of hovering angels!”</p>
  <p>To <i>me</i> they looked very ordinary clouds
  indeed: but then <i>I</i> had not fed ‘<i>on honey-dew,
  And drunk the milk of Paradise</i>’!</p>
  <p>“She wants to see you—at once,” he
  continued, descending suddenly to the things
  of earth. “She says <i>that</i> is the <i>one</i> drop yet
  wanting in her cup of happiness!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
  <p>“I’ll go at once,” I said, as I turned to leave
  the room. “Wo’n’t you come with me?”</p>
  <p>“No, Sir!” said the Doctor, with a sudden
  effort—which proved an utter failure—to
  resume his professional manner. “Do I <i>look</i>
  like coming with you? Have you never heard
  that two is company, and——”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” I said, “I <i>have</i> heard it: and I’m
  painfully aware that<i> I</i> am <i>Number Three</i>! But,
  <i>when</i> shall we three meet again?”</p>
  <p>“<i>When the hurly-burly’s done!</i>” he answered
  with a happy laugh, such as I had not heard
  from him for many a year.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
  <h2 id="c7">CHAPTER VII.
  <br><span class="small">MEIN HERR.</span></h2>
  <p>So I went on my lonely way, and, on reaching
  the Hall, I found Lady Muriel standing at
  the garden-gate waiting for me.</p>
  <p>“No need to <i>give</i> you joy, or to <i>wish</i> you
  joy?” I began.</p>
  <p>“None <i>whatever</i>!” she replied, with the
  joyous laugh of a child. “We <i>give</i> people what
  they haven’t got: we <i>wish</i> for something that
  is yet to come. For <i>me</i>, it’s all <i>here</i>! It’s all
  <i>mine</i>! Dear friend,” she suddenly broke off,
  “do you think Heaven ever begins on <i>Earth</i>,
  for any of us?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
  <p>“For <i>some</i>,” I said. “For some, perhaps, who
  are simple and childlike. You know He said
  ‘of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.’”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel clasped her hands, and gazed up
  into the cloudless sky, with a look I had often
  seen in Sylvie’s eyes. “I feel as if it had begun
  for <i>me</i>,” she almost whispered. “I feel as if <i>I</i>
  were one of the happy children, whom He bid
  them bring near to Him, though the people
  would have kept them back. Yes, He has seen
  me in the throng. He has read the wistful
  longing in my eyes. He has beckoned me to
  Him. They have <i>had</i> to make way for me.
  He has taken me up in His arms. He has put
  His hands upon me and blessed me!” She
  paused, breathless in her perfect happiness.</p>
  <p>“Yes,” I said. “I think He has!”</p>
  <p>“You must come and speak to my father,”
  she went on, as we stood side by side at the
  gate, looking down the shady lane. But, even
  as she said the words, the ‘eerie’ sensation
  came over me like a flood: I saw the dear
  old Professor approaching us, and also saw,
  what was stranger still, that he was visible to
  <i>Lady Muriel</i>!</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
  <p>What was to be done? Had the fairy-life
  been merged in the real life? Or was Lady
  Muriel ‘eerie’ also, and thus able to enter into
  the fairy-world along with me? The words
  were on my lips (“I see an old friend of mine
  in the lane: if you don’t know him, may I
  introduce him to you?”) when the strangest
  thing of all happened: Lady Muriel spoke.</p>
  <p>“I see an old friend of mine in the lane,”
  she said: “if you don’t know him, may I
  introduce him to you?”</p>
  <p>I seemed to wake out of a dream: for the
  ‘eerie’ feeling was still strong upon me, and
  the figure outside seemed to be changing at
  every moment, like one of the shapes in a
  kaleidoscope: now he was the <i>Professor</i>, and
  now he was somebody else! By the time he
  had reached the gate, he certainly was somebody
  else: and I felt that the proper course
  was for <i>Lady Muriel</i>, not for <i>me</i>, to introduce
  him. She greeted him kindly, and, opening
  the gate, admitted the venerable old man—a
  German, obviously—who looked about him
  with dazed eyes, as if <i>he</i>, too, had but just
  awaked from a dream!</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
  <p>No, it was certainly <i>not</i> the Professor! My
  old friend <i>could</i> not have grown that magnificent
  beard since last we met: moreover, he
  would have recognised <i>me</i>, for I was certain
  that <i>I</i> had not changed much in the time.</p>
  <p>As it was, he simply looked at me vaguely,
  and took off his hat in response to Lady
  Muriel’s words “Let me introduce Mein Herr
  to you”; while in the words, spoken in a
  strong German accent, “proud to make your
  acquaintance, Sir!” I could detect no trace
  of an idea that we had ever met before.</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel led us to the well-known shady
  nook, where preparations for afternoon tea had
  already been made, and, while she went in to
  look for the Earl, we seated ourselves in two
  easy-chairs, and ‘Mein Herr’ took up Lady
  Muriel’s work, and examined it through his
  large spectacles (one of the adjuncts that
  made him so provokingly like the Professor).
  “Hemming pocket-handkerchiefs?” he said,
  musingly. “So <i>that</i> is what the English
  miladies occupy themselves with, is it?”</p>
  <p>“It is the one accomplishment,” I said, “in
  which Man has never yet rivaled Woman!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
  <p>Here Lady Muriel returned with her father;
  and, after he had exchanged some friendly
  words with ‘Mein Herr,’ and we had all been
  supplied with the needful ‘creature-comforts,’
  the newcomer returned to the suggestive subject
  of Pocket-handkerchiefs.</p>
  <p>“You have heard of Fortunatus’s Purse,
  Miladi? Ah, so! Would you be surprised
  to hear that, with three of these leetle handkerchiefs,
  you shall make the Purse of Fortunatus,
  quite soon, quite easily?”</p>
  <p>“Shall I indeed?” Lady Muriel eagerly
  replied, as she took a heap of them into her
  lap, and threaded her needle. “<i>Please</i> tell
  me how, Mein Herr! I’ll make one before
  I touch another drop of tea!”</p>
  <p>“You shall first,” said Mein Herr, possessing
  himself of two of the handkerchiefs, spreading
  one upon the other, and holding them up by
  two corners, “you shall first join together
  these upper corners, the right to the right,
  the left to the left; and the opening between
  them shall be the <i>mouth</i> of the Purse.”</p>
  <p>A very few stitches sufficed to carry out <i>this</i>
  direction. “Now, if I sew the other three
  <span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
  edges together,” she suggested, “the bag is
  complete?”</p>
  <p>“Not so, Miladi: the <i>lower</i> edges shall <i>first</i>
  be joined—ah, not so!” (as she was beginning
  to sew them together). “Turn one of them
  over, and join the <i>right</i> lower corner of the
  one to the <i>left</i> lower corner of the other, and
  sew the lower edges together in what you
  would call <i>the wrong way</i>.”</p>
  <p>“<i>I</i> see!” said Lady Muriel, as she deftly
  executed the order. “And a very twisted,
  uncomfortable, uncanny-looking bag it makes!
  But the <i>moral</i> is a lovely one. Unlimited
  wealth can only be attained by doing things
  <i>in the wrong way</i>! And how are we to join
  up these mysterious—no, I mean <i>this</i> mysterious
  opening?” (twisting the thing round
  and round with a puzzled air.) “Yes, it <i>is</i> one
  opening. I thought it was <i>two</i>, at first.”</p>
  <p>“You have seen the puzzle of the Paper
  Ring?” Mein Herr said, addressing the Earl.
  “Where you take a slip of paper, and join
  its ends together, first twisting one, so as to
  join the <i>upper</i> corner of <i>one</i> end to the <i>lower</i>
  corner of the <i>other</i>?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
  <p>“I saw one made, only yesterday,” the
  Earl replied. “Muriel, my child, were you
  not making one, to amuse those children you
  had to tea?”</p>
  <p>“Yes, I know that Puzzle,” said Lady
  Muriel. “The Ring has only <i>one</i> surface, and
  only <i>one</i> edge. It’s very mysterious!”</p>
  <p>“The <i>bag</i> is just like that, isn’t it?” I suggested.
  “Is not the <i>outer</i> surface of one side
  of it continuous with the <i>inner</i> surface of the
  other side?”</p>
  <p>“So it is!” she exclaimed. “Only it <i>isn’t</i>
  a bag, just yet. How shall we fill up this
  opening, Mein Herr?”</p>
  <p>“Thus!” said the old man impressively,
  taking the bag from her, and rising to his feet
  in the excitement of the explanation. “The
  edge of the opening consists of <i>four</i> handkerchief-edges,
  and you can trace it continuously,
  round and round the opening: down the
  right edge of <i>one</i> handkerchief, up the left edge
  of the <i>other</i>, and then down the left edge of
  the <i>one</i>, and up the right edge of the <i>other</i>!”</p>
  <p>“So you can!” Lady Muriel murmured
  thoughtfully, leaning her head on her hand,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_103">103</span>
  and earnestly watching the old man. “And
  that <i>proves</i> it to be only <i>one</i> opening!”</p>

  <p>She looked so strangely like a child, puzzling
  over a difficult lesson, and Mein Herr had
  become, for the moment, so strangely like the
  old Professor, that I felt utterly bewildered:
  the ‘eerie’ feeling was on me in its full force,
  and I felt almost <i>impelled</i> to say “Do you
  understand it, Sylvie?” However I checked
  myself by a great effort, and let the dream
  (if indeed it <i>was</i> a dream) go on to its end.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
  <p>“Now, this <i>third</i> handkerchief,” Mein Herr
  proceeded, “has <i>also</i> four edges, which you
  can trace continuously round and round: all
  you need do is to join its four edges to the
  four edges of the opening. The Purse is then
  complete, and its outer surface——”</p>
  <p>“<i>I</i> see!” Lady Muriel eagerly interrupted.
  “Its <i>outer</i> surface will be continuous with its
  <i>inner</i> surface! But it will take time. I’ll sew
  it up after tea.” She laid aside the bag and
  resumed her cup of tea. “But why do you
  call it Fortunatus’s Purse, Mein Herr?”</p>
  <p>The dear old man beamed upon her, with a
  jolly smile, looking more exactly like the Professor
  than ever. “Don’t you see, my child—I
  should say Miladi? Whatever is <i>inside</i>
  that Purse, is <i>outside</i> it; and whatever is <i>outside</i>
  it, is <i>inside</i> it. So you have all the
  wealth of the world in that leetle Purse!”</p>
  <p>His pupil clapped her hands, in unrestrained
  delight. “I’ll certainly sew the third handkerchief
  in—<i>some</i> time,” she said: “but I
  wo’n’t take up your time by trying it now.
  Tell us some more wonderful things, please!”
  And her face and her voice so <i>exactly</i> recalled
  <span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
  Sylvie, that I could not help glancing round,
  half-expecting to see <i>Bruno</i> also!</p>
  <p>Mein Herr began thoughtfully balancing his
  spoon on the edge of his teacup, while he
  pondered over this request. “Something
  wonderful—like  Fortunatus’s Purse? <i>That</i>
  will give you—when it is made—wealth
  beyond your wildest dreams: but it will not
  give you <i>Time</i>!”</p>
  <p>A pause of silence ensued—utilised by
  Lady Muriel for the very practical purpose
  of refilling the teacups.</p>
  <p>“In <i>your</i> country,” Mein Herr began with a
  startling abruptness, “what becomes of all the
  wasted Time?”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel looked grave. “Who can
  tell?” she half-whispered to herself. “All one
  knows is that it is gone—past recall!”</p>
  <p>“Well, in <i>my</i>—I mean in a country <i>I</i> have
  visited,” said the old man, “they store it up:
  and it comes in <i>very</i> useful, years afterwards!
  For example, suppose you have a long tedious
  evening before you: nobody to talk to: nothing
  you care to do: and yet hours too soon to go
  to bed. How do <i>you</i> behave then?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
  <p>“I get <i>very</i> cross,” she frankly admitted:
  “and I want to throw things about the room!”</p>
  <p>“When that happens to—to the people I
  have visited, they never act <i>so</i>. By a short and
  simple process—which I cannot explain to you—they
  store up the useless hours: and, on
  some <i>other</i> occasion, when they happen to <i>need</i>
  extra time, they get them out again!”</p>
  <p>The Earl was listening with a slightly incredulous
  smile. “Why cannot you <i>explain</i> the
  process?” he enquired.</p>
  <p>Mein Herr was ready with a quite unanswerable
  reason. “Because you have no <i>words</i>, in
  <i>your</i> language, to convey the ideas which are
  needed. I could explain it in—in—but you
  would not understand it!”</p>
  <p>“No indeed!” said Lady Muriel, graciously
  dispensing with the <i>name</i> of the unknown
  language. “I never learnt it—at least, not
  to speak it <i>fluently</i>, you know. <i>Please</i> tell us
  some more wonderful things!”</p>
  <p>“They run their railway-trains without any
  engines—nothing is needed but machinery to
  <i>stop</i> them with. Is <i>that</i> wonderful enough,
  Miladi?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
  <p>“But where does the <i>force</i> come from?” I
  ventured to ask.</p>
  <p>Mein Herr turned quickly round, to look at
  the new speaker. Then he took off his spectacles,
  and polished them, and looked at me
  again, in evident bewilderment. I could see
  he was thinking—as indeed <i>I</i> was also—that
  we <i>must</i> have met before.</p>
  <p>“They use the force of <i>gravity</i>,” he said.
  “It is a force known also in <i>your</i> country, I
  believe?”</p>
  <p>“But that would need a railway going <i>down-hill</i>,”
  the Earl remarked. “You ca’n’t have <i>all</i>
  your railways going down-hill?”</p>
  <p>“They <i>all</i> do,” said Mein Herr.</p>
  <p>“Not from <i>both</i> ends?”</p>
  <p>“From <i>both</i> ends.”</p>
  <p>“Then I give it up!” said the Earl.</p>
  <p>“Can you explain the process?” said Lady
  Muriel. “Without using that language, that I
  ca’n’t speak fluently?”</p>
  <p>“Easily,” said Mein Herr. “Each railway
  is in a long tunnel, perfectly straight: so of
  course the <i>middle</i> of it is nearer the centre of
  the globe than the two ends: so every train
  <span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
  runs half-way <i>down</i>-hill, and that gives it force
  enough to run the <i>other</i> half <i>up</i>-hill.”</p>
  <p>“Thank you. I understand that perfectly,”
  said Lady Muriel. “But the velocity, in the
  <i>middle</i> of the tunnel, must be something
  <i>fearful</i>!”</p>
  <p>‘Mein Herr’ was evidently much gratified
  at the intelligent interest Lady Muriel took in
  his remarks. At every moment the old man
  seemed to grow more chatty and more fluent.
  “You would like to know our methods of
  <i>driving</i>?” he smilingly enquired. “To us, a
  run-away horse is of no import at all!”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel slightly shuddered. “To <i>us</i>
  it is a very real danger,” she said.</p>
  <p>“That is because your carriage is wholly
  <i>behind</i> your horse. Your horse runs. Your
  carriage follows. Perhaps your horse has the
  bit in his teeth. Who shall stop him? You
  fly, ever faster and faster! Finally comes the
  inevitable upset!”</p>
  <p>“But suppose <i>your</i> horse manages to get the
  bit in his teeth?”</p>
  <p>“No matter! We would not concern ourselves.
  Our horse is harnessed in the very
  <span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
  centre of our carriage. Two wheels are in
  front of him, and two behind. To the roof is
  attached one end of a broad belt. This goes
  under the horse’s body, and the other end is
  attached to a leetle—what you call a ‘windlass,’
  I think. The horse takes the bit in his
  teeth. He runs away. We are flying at ten
  miles an hour! We turn our little windlass,
  five turns, six turns, seven turns, and—poof!
  Our horse is off the ground! <i>Now</i> let him
  gallop in the air, as much as he pleases: our
  <i>carriage</i> stands still. We sit round him, and
  watch him till he is tired. Then we let him
  down. Our horse is glad, very much glad,
  when his feet once more touch the ground!”</p>
  <p>“Capital!” said the Earl, who had been
  listening attentively. “Are there any other
  peculiarities in your carriages?”</p>
  <p>“In the <i>wheels</i>, sometimes, my Lord. For
  your health, <i>you</i> go to sea: to be pitched, to
  be rolled, occasionally to be drowned. <i>We</i> do
  all that on land: we are pitched, as you; we
  are rolled, as you; but <i>drowned</i>, no! There
  is no water!”</p>
  <p>“What are the wheels like, then?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
  <p>“They are <i>oval</i>, my Lord. Therefore the
  carriages rise and fall.”</p>
  <p>“Yes, and pitch the carriage backwards and
  forwards: but how do they make it <i>roll</i>?”</p>
  <p>“They do not match, my Lord. The <i>end</i> of
  one wheel answers to the <i>side</i> of the opposite
  wheel. So first one side of the carriage rises,
  then the other. And it pitches all the while.
  Ah, you must be a good sailor, to drive in our
  boat-carriages!”</p>
  <p>“I can easily believe it,” said the Earl.</p>
  <p>Mein Herr rose to his feet. “I must leave
  you now, Miladi,” he said, consulting his watch.
  “I have another engagement.”</p>
  <p>“I only wish we had stored up some extra
  time!” Lady Muriel said, as she shook hands
  with him. “Then we could have kept you a
  little longer!”</p>
  <p>“In <i>that</i> case I would gladly stay,” replied
  Mein Herr. “As it is—I fear I must say
  good-bye!”</p>
  <p>“Where did you first meet him?” I asked
  Lady Muriel, when Mein Herr had left us.
  “And where does he live? And what is his
  real name?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
  <p>“We first—met—him——” she musingly
  replied, “really, I ca’n’t remember <i>where</i>!
  And I’ve no idea where he lives! And I
  never heard any other name! It’s very
  curious. It never occurred to me before to
  consider what a mystery he is!”</p>
  <p>“I hope we shall meet again,” I said: “he
  interests me very much.”</p>
  <p>“He will be at our farewell-party, this day
  fortnight,” said the Earl. “Of course you will
  come? Muriel is anxious to gather all our
  friends around us once more, before we leave
  the place.”</p>
  <p>And then he explained to me—as Lady
  Muriel had left us together—that he was so
  anxious to get his daughter away from a place
  full of so many painful memories connected
  with the now-canceled engagement with Major
  Lindon, that they had arranged to have the
  wedding in a months time, after which Arthur
  and his wife were to go on a foreign tour.</p>
  <p>“Don’t forget Tuesday week!” he said as
  we shook hands at parting. “I only wish you
  could bring with you those charming children,
  that you introduced to us in the summer.
  <span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
  Talk of the mystery of Mein Herr! That’s
  <i>nothing</i> to the mystery that seems to attend
  <i>them</i>! I shall never forget those marvellous
  flowers!”</p>
  <p>“I will bring them if I possibly can,” I said.
  But how to <i>fulfil</i> such a promise, I mused to
  myself on my way back to our lodgings, was
  a problem entirely beyond my skill!</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
  <h2 id="c8">CHAPTER VIII.
  <br><span class="small">IN A SHADY PLACE.</span></h2>
  <p>The ten days glided swiftly away: and, the
  day before the great party was to take place,
  Arthur proposed that we should stroll down
  to the Hall, in time for afternoon-tea.</p>
  <p>“Hadn’t you better go <i>alone</i>?” I suggested.
  “Surely <i>I</i> shall be very much <i>de trop</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Well, it’ll be a kind of <i>experiment</i>,” he
  said. “<i>Fiat experimentum in corpore vili!</i>”
  he added, with a graceful bow of mock politeness
  towards the unfortunate victim. “You
  see I shall have to bear the sight, to-morrow
  night, of my lady-love making herself agreable
  <span class="pb" id="Page_114">114</span>
  to everybody <i>except</i> the right person, and I
  shall bear the agony all the better if we have
  a dress-rehearsal beforehand!”</p>
  <p>“<i>My</i> part in the play being, apparently, that
  of the sample <i>wrong</i> person?”</p>
  <p>“Well, no,” Arthur said musingly, as we set
  forth: “there’s no such part in a regular
  company. ‘Heavy Father’? <i>That</i> won’t do:
  that’s filled already. ‘Singing Chambermaid’?
  Well, the ‘First Lady’ doubles <i>that</i> part.
  ‘Comic Old Man’? You’re not comic enough.
  After all, I’m afraid there’s no part for you
  but the ‘Well-dressed Villain’: only,” with a
  critical side-glance, “I’m a <i>leetle</i> uncertain
  about the dress!”</p>
  <p>We found Lady Muriel alone, the Earl
  having gone out to make a call, and at once
  resumed old terms of intimacy, in the shady
  arbour where the tea-things seemed to be
  always waiting. The only novelty in the
  arrangements (one which Lady Muriel seemed
  to regard as <i>entirely</i> a matter of course), was
  that two of the chairs were placed <i>quite</i> close
  together, side by side. Strange to say, <i>I</i> was
  not invited to occupy <i>either</i> of them!</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
  <p>“We have been arranging, as we came
  along, about letter-writing,” Arthur began.
  “He will want to know how we’re enjoying
  our Swiss tour: and of course we must pretend
  we <i>are</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Of course,” she meekly assented.</p>
  <p>“And the skeleton-in-the-cupboard——” I
  suggested.</p>
  <p>“—is always a difficulty,” she quickly put
  in, “when you’re traveling about, and when
  there are no cupboards in the hotels. However,
  <i>ours</i> is a <i>very</i> portable one; and will be
  neatly packed, in a nice leather case——”</p>
  <p>“But please don’t think about <i>writing</i>,” I
  said, “when you’ve anything more attractive
  on hand. I delight in <i>reading</i> letters, but I
  know well how tiring it is to <i>write</i> them.”</p>
  <p>“It <i>is</i>, sometimes,” Arthur assented. “For
  instance, when you’re very shy of the person
  you have to write to.”</p>
  <p>“Does that show itself in the <i>letter</i>?” Lady
  Muriel enquired. “Of course, when I hear
  any one <i>talking</i>—<i>you</i>, for instance—I can
  see how <i>desperately</i> shy he is! But can you
  see that in a <i>letter</i>?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
  <p>“Well, of course, when you hear any one
  talk <i>fluently</i>—<i>you</i>, for instance—you can see
  how desperately <i>un</i>-shy she is—not to say
  saucy! But the shyest and most intermittent
  talker must <i>seem</i> fluent in letter-writing. He
  may have taken half-an-hour to <i>compose</i> his
  second sentence; but there it is, close after
  the first!”</p>
  <p>“Then letters don’t express all that they
  <i>might</i> express?”</p>
  <p>“That’s merely because our system of letter-writing
  is incomplete. A shy writer <i>ought</i> to
  be able to show that he is so. Why shouldn’t
  he make <i>pauses</i> in writing, just as he would
  do in speaking? He might leave blank spaces—say
  half a page at a time. And a <i>very</i> shy
  girl—if there <i>is</i> such a thing—might write
  a sentence on the <i>first</i> sheet of her letter—then
  put in a couple of <i>blank</i> sheets—then
  a sentence on the <i>fourth</i> sheet: and so on.”</p>
  <p>“I quite foresee that <i>we</i>—I mean this clever
  little boy and myself—” Lady Muriel said to
  me, evidently with the kind wish to bring me
  into the conversation, “—are going to become
  famous—of course all our inventions are
  <span class="pb" id="Page_117">117</span>
  common property now—for a new Code of
  Rules for Letter-writing! Please invent some
  more, little boy!”</p>
  <p>“Well, another thing <i>greatly</i> needed, little
  girl, is some way of expressing that we <i>don’t</i>
  mean anything.”</p>
  <p>“Explain yourself, little boy! Surely <i>you</i>
  can find no difficulty in expressing a <i>total</i>
  absence of meaning?”</p>
  <p>“I mean that you should be able, when you
  <i>don’t</i> mean a thing to be taken seriously, to
  express that wish. For human nature is so
  constituted that whatever you write seriously
  is taken as a joke, and whatever you mean
  as a joke is taken seriously! At any rate, it
  is so in writing to a <i>lady</i>!”</p>
  <p>“Ah! you’re not used to writing to ladies!”
  Lady Muriel remarked, leaning back in her
  chair, and gazing thoughtfully into the sky.
  “You should try.”</p>
  <p>“Very good,” said Arthur. “How many
  ladies may I begin writing to? As many as I
  can count on the fingers of both hands?”</p>
  <p>“As many as you can count on the <i>thumbs</i>
  of <i>one</i> hand!” his lady-love replied with much
  <span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
  severity. “What a <i>very</i> naughty little boy he
  is! <i>Isn’t</i> he?” (with an appealing glance at
  me).</p>
  <p>“He’s a little fractious,” I said. “Perhaps
  he’s cutting a tooth.” While to myself I said
  “How <i>exactly</i> like Sylvie talking to Bruno!”</p>
  <p>“He wants his tea.” (The naughty little boy
  volunteered the information.) “He’s getting
  very tired, at the mere <i>prospect</i> of the great
  party to-morrow!”</p>
  <p>“Then he shall have a good rest beforehand!”
  she soothingly replied. “The tea isn’t
  made yet. Come, little boy, lean well back in
  your chair, and think about nothing—or about
  <i>me</i>, whichever you prefer!”</p>
  <p>“All the same, all the same!” Arthur sleepily
  murmured, watching her with loving eyes,
  as she moved her chair away to the tea table,
  and began to make the tea. “Then he’ll wait
  for his tea, like a good, patient little boy!”</p>
  <p>“Shall I bring you the London Papers?”
  said Lady Muriel. “I saw them lying on the
  table as I came out, but my father said there
  was nothing in them, except that horrid murder-trial.”
  (Society was just then enjoying its daily
  <span class="pb" id="Page_119">119</span>
  thrill of excitement in studying the details of a
  specially sensational murder in a thieves’ den in
  the East of London.)</p>
  <p>“I have no appetite for horrors,” Arthur
  replied. “But I hope we have learned the
  lesson they should teach us—though we are
  very apt to read it backwards!”</p>
  <div class="img" id="fig11">
  <img alt="‘I AM SITTING AT YOUR FEET’" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i119.jpg" id="id-1555437476661935898" width="500" height="358">
  <p class="center small">‘I AM SITTING AT YOUR FEET’</p>
  </div>
  <p>“You speak in riddles,” said Lady Muriel.
  “Please explain yourself. See now,” suiting
  the action to the word, “I am sitting at your
  feet, just as if you were a second Gamaliel!
  <span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
  Thanks, no.” (This was to me, who had risen
  to bring her chair back to its former place.)
  “Pray don’t disturb yourself. This tree and
  the grass make a very nice easy-chair. <i>What</i> is
  the lesson that one always reads wrong?”</p>
  <p>Arthur was silent for a minute. “I would
  like to be clear what it <i>is</i> I mean,” he said,
  slowly and thoughtfully, “before I say anything
  to <i>you</i>—because you <i>think</i> about it.”</p>
  <p>Anything approaching to a compliment was
  so unusual an utterance for Arthur, that it
  brought a flush of pleasure to her cheek, as she
  replied “It is <i>you</i>, that give me the ideas to
  think about.”</p>
  <p>“One’s first thought,” Arthur proceeded, “in
  reading of anything specially vile or barbarous,
  as done by a fellow-creature, is apt to be that
  we see a new depth of Sin revealed <i>beneath</i> us:
  and we seem to gaze down into that abyss from
  some higher ground, far apart from it.”</p>
  <p>“I think I understand you now. You mean
  that one ought to think—not ‘God, I thank
  Thee that I am not as other men are’—but
  ‘God, be merciful to me also, who might be,
  but for Thy grace, a sinner as vile as he!’”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
  <p>“No,” said Arthur. “I meant a great deal
  more than that.”</p>
  <p>She looked up quickly, but checked herself,
  and waited in silence.</p>
  <p>“One must begin further back, I think.
  Think of some other man, the same age as this
  poor wretch. Look back to the time when
  they both began life—before they had sense
  enough to know Right from Wrong. <i>Then</i>, at
  any rate, they were equal in God’s sight?”</p>
  <p>She nodded assent.</p>
  <p>“We have, then, two distinct epochs at which
  we may contemplate the two men whose lives
  we are comparing. At the first epoch they are,
  so far as moral responsibility is concerned, on
  precisely the same footing: they are alike
  incapable of doing right or wrong. At the
  second epoch the one man—I am taking an
  extreme case, for contrast—has won the esteem
  and love of all around him: his character is
  stainless, and his name will be held in honour
  hereafter: the other man’s history is one
  unvaried record of crime, and his life is at last
  forfeited to the outraged laws of his country.
  Now what have been the causes, in each case,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_122">122</span>
  of each man’s condition being what it is at the
  second epoch? They are of two kinds—one
  acting from within, the other from without.
  These two kinds need to be discussed separately—that
  is, if I have not already tired you
  with my prosing?”</p>
  <p>“On the contrary,” said Lady Muriel, “it is
  a special delight to me to have a question
  discussed in this way—analysed and arranged,
  so that one can understand it. Some books,
  that profess to argue out a question, are to me
  intolerably wearisome, simply because the ideas
  are all arranged hap-hazard—a sort of ‘first
  come, first served.’”</p>
  <p>“You are very encouraging,” Arthur replied,
  with a pleased look. “The causes, acting from
  <i>within</i>, which make a man’s character what it is
  at any given moment, are his successive acts of
  volition—that is, his acts of choosing whether
  he will do this or that.”</p>
  <p>“We are to assume the existence of Free-Will?”
  I said, in order to have that point made
  quite clear.</p>
  <p>“If not,” was the quiet reply, “<i>cadit
  quaestio</i>: and I have no more to say.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
  <p>“We <i>will</i> assume it!” the rest of the
  audience—the majority, I may say, looking at
  it from Arthur’s point of view—imperiously
  proclaimed. The orator proceeded.</p>
  <p>“The causes, acting from <i>without</i>, are his
  surroundings—what Mr. Herbert Spencer
  calls his ‘environment.’ Now the point I want
  to make clear is this, that a man is responsible
  for his acts of choosing, but <i>not</i> responsible
  for his environment. Hence, if these two men
  make, on some given occasion, when they are
  exposed to equal temptation, equal efforts to
  resist and to choose the right, their condition,
  in the sight of God, must be the same. If He
  is pleased in the one case, so will He be in the
  other; if displeased in the one case, so also in
  the other.”</p>
  <p>“That is so, no doubt: I see it quite clearly,”
  Lady Muriel put in.</p>
  <p>“And yet, owing to their different environments,
  the one may win a great victory over the
  temptation, while the other falls into some black
  abyss of crime.”</p>
  <p>“But surely you would not say those men
  were equally guilty in the sight of God?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
  <p>“Either that,” said Arthur, “or else I must
  give up my belief in God’s perfect justice.
  But let me put one more case, which will show
  my meaning even more forcibly. Let the one
  man be in a high social position—the other,
  say, a common thief. Let the one be tempted
  to some trivial act of unfair dealing—something
  which he can do with the absolute
  certainty that it will never be discovered—something
  which he can with perfect ease
  forbear from doing—and which he distinctly
  knows to be a sin. Let the other be tempted
  to some terrible crime—as men would consider
  it—but under an almost overwhelming pressure
  of motives—of course not <i>quite</i> overwhelming,
  as that would destroy all responsibility. Now,
  in this case, let the second man make a <i>greater</i>
  effort at resistance than the first. Also suppose
  <i>both</i> to fall under the temptation—I say that
  the second man is, in God’s sight, <i>less</i> guilty
  than the other.”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel drew a long breath. “It upsets
  all one’s ideas of Right and Wrong—just at
  first! Why, in that dreadful murder-trial, you
  would say, I suppose, that it was possible that
  <span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
  the least guilty man in the Court was the
  murderer, and that possibly the judge who
  tried him, by yielding to the temptation of
  making one unfair remark, had committed a
  crime outweighing the criminal’s whole career!”</p>
  <p>“Certainly I should,” Arthur firmly replied.
  “It sounds like a paradox, I admit. But just
  think what a grievous sin it must be, in God’s
  sight, to yield to some very slight temptation,
  which we could have resisted with perfect ease,
  and to do it deliberately, and in the full light
  of God’s Law. What penance can atone for
  a sin like <i>that</i>?”</p>
  <p>“I ca’n’t reject your theory,” I said. “But
  how it seems to widen the possible area of Sin
  in the world!”</p>
  <p>“Is that so?” Lady Muriel anxiously
  enquired.</p>
  <p>“Oh, not so, not so!” was the eager reply.
  “To me it seems to clear away much of the
  cloud that hangs over the world’s history.
  When this view first made itself clear to me,
  I remember walking out into the fields, repeating
  to myself that line of Tennyson ‘<i>There
  seemed no room for sense of wrong!</i>’ The
  <span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
  thought, that perhaps the real guilt of the
  human race was infinitely less than I fancied
  it—that the millions, whom I had thought of
  as sunk in hopeless depths of sin, were perhaps,
  in God’s sight, scarcely sinning at all—was
  more sweet than words can tell! Life
  seemed more bright and beautiful, when once
  that thought had come! ‘<i>A livelier emerald
  twinkles in the grass, A purer sapphire melts
  into the sea!</i>’” His voice trembled as he
  concluded, and the tears stood in his eyes.</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel shaded her face with her hand,
  and was silent for a minute. “It is a beautiful
  thought,” she said, looking up at last. “Thank
  you—Arthur, for putting it into my head!”</p>
  <p>The Earl returned in time to join us at tea,
  and to give us the very unwelcome tidings that
  a fever had broken out in the little harbour-town
  that lay below us—a fever of so malignant
  a type that, though it had only appeared a
  day or two ago, there were already more than
  a dozen down in it, two or three of whom were
  reported to be in imminent danger.</p>
  <p>In answer to the eager questions of Arthur—who
  of course took a deep scientific interest
  <span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
  in the matter—he could give very few <i>technical</i>
  details, though he had met the local doctor. It
  appeared, however, that it was an almost <i>new</i>
  disease—at least in <i>this</i> century, though it
  <i>might</i> prove to be identical with the ‘Plague’
  recorded in History—<i>very</i> infectious, and
  frightfully rapid in its action. “It will not,
  however, prevent our party to-morrow,” he
  said in conclusion. “None of the guests belong
  to the infected district, which is, as you
  know, exclusively peopled by fishermen: so
  you may come without any fear.”</p>
  <p>Arthur was very silent, all the way back,
  and, on reaching our lodgings, immediately
  plunged into medical studies, connected with
  the alarming malady of whose arrival we had
  just heard.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
  <h2 id="c9">CHAPTER IX.
  <br><span class="small">THE FAREWELL-PARTY.</span></h2>
  <p>On the following day, Arthur and I reached
  the Hall in good time, as only a few of the
  guests—it was to be a party of eighteen—had
  as yet arrived; and these were talking with
  the Earl, leaving us the opportunity of a few
  words apart with our hostess.</p>
  <p>“Who is that <i>very</i> learned-looking man with
  the large spectacles?” Arthur enquired. “I
  haven’t met him here before, have I?”</p>
  <p>“No, he’s a new friend of ours,” said Lady
  Muriel: “a German, I believe. He <i>is</i> such a
  dear old thing! And quite the most learned
  <span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
  man I ever met—with <i>one</i> exception, of
  course!” she added humbly, as Arthur drew
  himself up with an air of offended dignity.</p>
  <p>“And the young lady in blue, just beyond
  him, talking to that foreign-looking man. Is
  <i>she</i> learned, too?”</p>
  <p>“I don’t know,” said Lady Muriel. “But
  I’m told she’s a wonderful piano-forte-player. I
  hope you’ll hear her to-night. I asked that
  foreigner to take her in, because <i>he’s</i> very
  musical, too. He’s a French Count, I believe;
  and he sings <i>splendidly</i>!”</p>
  <p>“Science—music—singing—you have indeed
  got a complete party!” said Arthur. “I
  feel quite a privileged person, meeting all these
  stars. I <i>do</i> love music!”</p>
  <p>“But the party isn’t <i>quite</i> complete!” said
  Lady Muriel. “You haven’t brought us those
  two beautiful children,” she went on, turning
  to me. “He brought them here to tea, you
  know, one day last summer,” again addressing
  Arthur; “and they <i>are</i> such darlings!”</p>
  <p>“They are, <i>indeed</i>,” I assented.</p>
  <p>“But why haven’t you brought them with
  you? You promised my father you <i>would</i>.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
  <p>“I’m very sorry,” I said; “but really it was
  impossible to bring them with me.” Here I
  most certainly <i>meant</i> to conclude the sentence:
  and it was with a feeling of utter amazement,
  which I cannot adequately describe, that I
  heard myself <i>going on speaking</i>. “—but they
  are to join me here in the course of the evening”
  were the words, uttered in <i>my</i> voice, and
  seeming to come from <i>my</i> lips.</p>
  <p>“I’m <i>so</i> glad!” Lady Muriel joyfully replied.
  “I <i>shall</i> enjoy introducing them to some of my
  friends here! When do you expect them?”</p>
  <p>I took refuge in silence. The only <i>honest</i>
  reply would have been “That was not <i>my</i>
  remark. <i>I</i> didn’t say it, and <i>it isn’t true</i>!”
  But I had not the moral courage to make such
  a confession. The character of a ‘lunatic’ is
  not, I believe, very difficult to <i>acquire</i>: but it
  is amazingly difficult to <i>get rid of</i>: and it
  seemed quite certain that any such speech as
  <i>that</i> would <i>quite</i> justify the issue of a writ ‘<i>de
  lunatico inquirendo</i>.’</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel evidently thought I had failed
  to hear her question, and turned to Arthur
  with a remark on some other subject; and I
  <span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
  had time to recover from my shock of surprise—or
  to awake out of my momentary ‘eerie’
  condition, whichever it was.</p>
  <p>When things around me seemed once more
  to be real, Arthur was saying “I’m afraid
  there’s no help for it: they <i>must</i> be finite in
  number.”</p>
  <p>“I should be sorry to have to believe it,”
  said Lady Muriel. “Yet, when one comes to
  think of it, there <i>are</i> no new melodies, now-a-days.
  What people talk of as ‘the last new
  song’ always recalls to <i>me</i> some tune I’ve
  known as a child!”</p>
  <p>“The day must come—if the world lasts
  long enough——” said Arthur, “when every
  possible tune will have been composed—every
  possible pun perpetrated——” (Lady Muriel
  wrung her hands, like a tragedy-queen) “and,
  worse than that, every possible <i>book</i> written!
  For the number of <i>words</i> is finite.”</p>
  <p>“It’ll make very little difference to the
  <i>authors</i>,” I suggested. “Instead of saying
  ‘<i>what</i> book shall I write?’ an author will ask
  himself ‘<i>which</i> book shall I write?’ A mere
  verbal distinction!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
  <p>Lady Muriel gave me an approving smile.
  “But <i>lunatics</i> would always write new books,
  surely?” she went on. “They <i>couldn’t</i> write
  the sane books over again!”</p>
  <p>“True,” said Arthur. “But <i>their</i> books
  would come to an end, also. The number of
  lunatic <i>books</i> is as finite as the number of
  lunatics.”</p>
  <p>“And <i>that</i> number is becoming greater
  every year,” said a pompous man, whom I
  recognised as the self-appointed showman on
  the day of the picnic.</p>
  <p>“So they say,” replied Arthur. “And, when
  ninety per cent. of us are lunatics,” (he seemed
  to be in a wildly nonsensical mood) “the
  asylums will be put to their proper use.”</p>
  <p>“And that is——?” the pompous man
  gravely enquired.</p>
  <p>“<i>To shelter the sane!</i>” said Arthur. “<i>We</i>
  shall bar ourselves in. The lunatics will have
  it all their own way, <i>outside</i>. They’ll do it
  a little queerly, no doubt. Railway-collisions
  will be always happening: steamers always
  blowing up: most of the towns will be burnt
  down: most of the ships sunk——”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
  <p>“And most of the men <i>killed</i>!” murmured
  the pompous man, who was evidently hopelessly
  bewildered.</p>
  <p>“Certainly,” Arthur assented. “Till at last
  there will be <i>fewer</i> lunatics than sane men.
  Then <i>we</i> come out: <i>they</i> go in: and things
  return to their normal condition!”</p>
  <p>The pompous man frowned darkly, and bit
  his lip, and folded his arms, vainly trying to
  think it out. “He is <i>jesting</i>!” he muttered
  to himself at last, in a tone of withering contempt,
  as he stalked away.</p>
  <p>By this time the other guests had arrived;
  and dinner was announced. Arthur of course
  took down Lady Muriel: and <i>I</i> was pleased
  to find myself seated at her other side, with
  a severe-looking old lady (whom I had not
  met before, and whose name I had, as is usual
  in introductions, entirely failed to catch, merely
  gathering that it sounded like a compound-name)
  as my partner for the banquet.</p>
  <p>She appeared, however, to be acquainted
  with Arthur, and confided to me in a low voice
  her opinion that he was “a very argumentative
  young man.” Arthur, for his part, seemed well
  <span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
  inclined to show himself worthy of the character
  she had given him, and, hearing her say “I
  never take wine with my soup!” (this was <i>not</i>
  a confidence to me, but was launched upon
  Society, as a matter of general interest), he
  at once challenged a combat by asking her
  “<i>when</i> would you say that property <i>commence</i>
  in a plate of soup?”</p>
  <p>“This is <i>my</i> soup,” she sternly replied:
  “and what is before you is <i>yours</i>.”</p>
  <p>“No doubt,” said Arthur: “but <i>when</i> did I
  begin to own it? Up to the moment of its
  being put into the plate, it was the property
  of our host: while being offered round the
  table, it was, let us say, held in trust by the
  waiter: did it become mine when I accepted
  it? Or when it was placed before me? Or
  when I took the first spoonful?”</p>
  <p>“He is a <i>very</i> argumentative young man!”
  was all the old lady would say: but she said
  it audibly, this time, feeling that Society had a
  right to know it.</p>
  <p>Arthur smiled mischievously. “I shouldn’t
  mind betting you a shilling,” he said, “that the
  Eminent Barrister next you” (It certainly <i>is</i>
  <span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
  possible to say words so as to make them
  begin with capitals!) “ca’n’t answer me!”</p>
  <p>“I <i>never</i> bet,” she sternly replied.</p>
  <p>“Not even sixpenny points at <i>whist</i>?”</p>
  <p>“<i>Never!</i>” she repeated. “<i>Whist</i> is innocent
  enough: but whist played for <i>money</i>!”
  She shuddered.</p>
  <p>Arthur became serious again. “I’m afraid I
  ca’n’t take that view,” he said. “I consider
  that the introduction of small stakes for card-playing
  was one of the most <i>moral</i> acts Society
  ever did, <i>as</i> Society.”</p>
  <p>“How was it so?” said Lady Muriel.</p>
  <p>“Because it took Cards, once for all, out of
  the category of games at which <i>cheating</i> is possible.
  Look at the way Croquet is demoralising
  Society. Ladies are beginning to cheat at it,
  terribly: and, if they’re found out, they only
  laugh, and call it fun. But when there’s <i>money</i>
  at stake, that is out of the question. The
  swindler is <i>not</i> accepted as a wit. When a
  man sits down to cards, and cheats his friends
  out of their money, he doesn’t get much <i>fun</i>
  out of it—unless he thinks it fun to be kicked
  down stairs!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
  <p>“If all gentlemen thought as badly of ladies
  as <i>you</i> do,” my neighbour remarked with some
  bitterness, “there would be very few—very
  few——.” She seemed doubtful how to end
  her sentence, but at last took “honeymoons”
  as a safe word.</p>
  <p>“On the contrary,” said Arthur, the mischievous
  smile returning to his face, “if only
  people would adopt <i>my</i> theory, the number of
  honeymoons—quite of a new kind—would
  be greatly increased!”</p>
  <p>“May we hear about this new kind of
  honeymoon?” said Lady Muriel.</p>
  <p>“Let <i>X</i> be the gentleman,” Arthur began, in
  a slightly raised voice, as he now found himself
  with an audience of <i>six</i>, including ‘Mein Herr,’
  who was seated at the other side of my polynomial
  partner. “Let <i>X</i> be the gentleman,
  and <i>Y</i> the lady to whom he thinks of proposing.
  He applies for an Experimental Honeymoon.
  It is granted. Forthwith the young couple—accompanied
  by the great-aunt of <i>Y</i>, to act as
  chaperone—start for a month’s tour, during
  which they have many a moonlight-walk, and
  many a <i>tête-à-tête</i> conversation, and each can
  <span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
  form a more correct estimate of the other’s
  character, in four <i>weeks</i>, than would have been
  possible in as many <i>years</i>, when meeting under
  the ordinary restrictions of Society. And it is
  only after their <i>return</i> that <i>X</i> finally decides
  whether he will, or will not, put the momentous
  question to <i>Y</i>!”</p>
  <p>“In nine cases out of ten,” the pompous man
  proclaimed, “he would decide to break it off!”</p>
  <p>“Then, in nine cases out of ten,” Arthur
  rejoined, “an unsuitable match would be prevented,
  and <i>both</i> parties saved from misery!”</p>
  <p>“The only really <i>unsuitable</i> matches,” the
  old lady remarked, “are those made without
  sufficient <i>Money</i>. Love may come <i>afterwards</i>.
  Money is needed <i>to begin with</i>!”</p>
  <p>This remark was cast loose upon Society, as
  a sort of general challenge; and, as such, it was
  at once accepted by several of those within
  hearing: <i>Money</i> became the key-note of the
  conversation for some time; and a fitful echo of
  it was again heard, when the dessert had been
  placed upon the table, the servants had left the
  room, and the Earl had started the wine in
  its welcome progress round the table.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_138">138</div>
  <p>“I’m very glad to see you keep up the old
  customs,” I said to Lady Muriel as I filled her
  glass. “It’s really delightful to experience,
  once more, the peaceful feeling that comes over
  one when the waiters have left the room—when
  one can converse without the feeling of
  being overheard, and without having dishes
  constantly thrust over one’s shoulder. How
  much more sociable it is to be able to pour
  out the wine for the ladies, and to hand the
  dishes to those who wish for them!”</p>
  <p>“In that case, kindly send those peaches
  down here,” said a fat red-faced man, who was
  seated beyond our pompous friend. “I’ve
  been wishing for them—diagonally—for some
  time!”</p>
  <p>“Yes, it <i>is</i> a ghastly innovation,” Lady
  Muriel replied, “letting the waiters carry round
  the wine at dessert. For one thing, they
  <i>always</i> take it the wrong way round—which of
  course brings bad luck to <i>everybody</i> present!”</p>
  <p>“Better go the <i>wrong</i> way than not go <i>at
  all</i>!” said our host. “Would you kindly help
  yourself?” (This was to the fat red-faced
  man.) “You are not a teetotaler, I think?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
  <p>“Indeed but I <i>am</i>!” he replied, as he
  pushed on the bottles. “Nearly twice as
  much money is spent in England on <i>Drink</i>,
  as on any other article of food. Read this
  card.” (What faddist ever goes about without
  a pocketful of the appropriate literature?)
  “The stripes of different colours represent the
  amounts spent on various articles of food.
  Look at the highest three. Money spent on
  butter and on cheese, thirty-five millions: on
  bread, seventy millions: on <i>intoxicating liquors</i>,
  one hundred and thirty-six millions! If I
  had my way, I would close every public-house
  in the land! Look at that card, and read the
  motto. <i>That’s where all the money goes to!</i>”</p>
  <p>“Have you seen the <i>Anti-Teetotal Card</i>?”
  Arthur innocently enquired.</p>
  <p>“No, Sir, I have not!” the orator savagely
  replied. “What is it like?”</p>
  <p>“Almost exactly like this one. The coloured
  stripes are the same. Only, instead of the
  words ‘Money spent on,’ it has ‘Incomes
  derived from sale of’; and, instead of ‘That’s
  where all the money goes to,’ its motto is
  ‘<i>That’s where all the money comes from!</i>’”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_140">140</div>
  <p>The red-faced man scowled, but evidently
  considered Arthur beneath his notice. So
  Lady Muriel took up the cudgels. “Do you
  hold the theory,” she enquired, “that people
  can preach teetotalism more effectually by being
  teetotalers themselves?”</p>
  <p>“Certainly I do!” replied the red-faced man.
  “Now, here is a case in point,” unfolding
  a newspaper-cutting: “let me read you this
  letter from a teetotaler. <i>To the Editor.
  Sir, I was once a moderate drinker, and knew
  a man who drank to excess. I went to him.
  ‘Give up this drink,’ I said. ‘It will ruin your
  health!’ ‘You drink,’ he said: ‘why shouldn’t
  I?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘but I know when to
  leave off.’ He turned away from me. ‘You
  drink in your way,’ he said: ‘let me drink
  in mine. Be off!’ Then I saw that, to do
  any good with him, I must forswear drink.
  From that hour I haven’t touched a drop!</i>”</p>
  <p>“There! What do you say to <i>that</i>?” He
  looked round triumphantly, while the cutting
  was handed round for inspection.</p>
  <p>“How very curious!” exclaimed Arthur,
  when it had reached him. “Did you happen
  <span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
  to see a letter, last week, about early rising?
  It was strangely like this one.”</p>
  <p>The red-faced man’s curiosity was roused.
  “Where did it appear?” he asked.</p>
  <p>“Let me read it to you,” said Arthur. He
  took some papers from his pocket, opened one
  of them, and read as follows. “<i>To the Editor.
  Sir, I was once a moderate sleeper, and knew a
  man who slept to excess. I pleaded with him.
  ‘Give up this lying in bed,’ I said, ‘It will
  ruin your health!’ ‘You go to bed,’ he said:
  ‘why shouldn’t I?’ ‘Yes,’ I said, ‘but I know
  when to get up in the morning.’ He turned away
  from me. ‘You sleep in your way,’ he said:
  ‘let me sleep in mine. Be off!’ Then I saw
  that to do any good with him, I must forswear
  sleep. From that hour I haven’t been to bed!</i>”</p>
  <p>Arthur folded and pocketed his paper, and
  passed on the newspaper-cutting. None of us
  dared to laugh, the red-faced man was
  evidently so angry. “Your parallel doesn’t run
  on all fours!” he snarled.</p>
  <p>“<i>Moderate</i> drinkers never do so!” Arthur
  quietly replied. Even the stern old lady
  laughed at this.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_142">142</div>
  <p>“But it needs many other things to make a
  <i>perfect</i> dinner!” said Lady Muriel, evidently
  anxious to change the subject. “Mein Herr!
  What is <i>your</i> idea of a perfect dinner-party?”</p>
  <p>The old man looked round smilingly, and
  his gigantic spectacles seemed more gigantic
  than ever. “A <i>perfect</i> dinner-party?” he
  repeated. “First, it must be presided over
  by our present hostess!”</p>
  <p>“That, of <i>course</i>!” she gaily interposed.
  “But what <i>else</i>, Mein Herr?”</p>
  <p>“I can but tell you what I have seen,” said
  Mein Herr, “in mine own—in the country I
  have traveled in.”</p>
  <p>He paused for a full minute, and gazed
  steadily at the ceiling—with so dreamy an
  expression on his face, that I feared he was
  going off into a reverie, which seemed to be
  his normal state. However, after a minute,
  he suddenly began again.</p>
  <p>“That which chiefly causes the failure of a
  dinner-party, is the running-short—not of meat,
  nor yet of drink, but of <i>conversation</i>.”</p>
  <p>“In an <i>English</i> dinner-party,” I remarked,
  “I have never known <i>small-talk</i> run short!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_143">143</div>
  <p>“Pardon me,” Mein Herr respectfully replied,
  “I did not say ‘small-talk.’ I said ‘conversation.’
  All such topics as the weather, or politics,
  or local gossip, are unknown among us. They
  are either vapid or controversial. What we
  need for <i>conversation</i> is a topic of <i>interest</i> and
  of <i>novelty</i>. To secure these things we have
  tried various plans—Moving-Pictures, Wild-Creatures,
  Moving-Guests, and a Revolving-Humorist.
  But this last is only adapted to
  <i>small</i> parties.”</p>
  <p>“Let us have it in four separate Chapters,
  please!” said Lady Muriel, who was evidently
  deeply interested—as, indeed, most of the
  party were, by this time: and, all down the
  table, talk had ceased, and heads were leaning
  forwards, eager to catch fragments of Mein
  Herr’s oration.</p>
  <p>“Chapter One! Moving-Pictures!” was proclaimed
  in the silvery voice of our hostess.</p>
  <p>“The dining-table is shaped like a circular
  ring,” Mein Herr began, in low dreamy tones,
  which, however, were perfectly audible in the
  silence. “The guests are seated at the inner
  side as well as the outer, having ascended to
  <span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
  their places by a winding-staircase, from the
  room below. Along the middle of the table
  runs a little railway; and there is an endless
  train of trucks, worked round by machinery;
  and on each truck there are two pictures, leaning
  back to back. The train makes two circuits
  during dinner; and, when it has been <i>once</i>
  round, the waiters turn the pictures round in
  each truck, making them face the other way.
  Thus <i>every</i> guest sees <i>every</i> picture!”</p>
  <p>He paused, and the silence seemed deader
  than ever. Lady Muriel looked aghast.
  “Really, if this goes on,” she exclaimed, “I
  shall have to drop a pin! Oh, it’s <i>my</i> fault, is
  it?” (In answer to an appealing look from Mein
  Herr.) “I was forgetting my duty. Chapter
  Two! Wild-Creatures!”</p>
  <p>“We found the Moving-Pictures a <i>little</i>
  monotonous,” said Mein Herr. “People
  didn’t care to talk Art through a whole dinner;
  so we tried Wild-Creatures. Among the flowers,
  which we laid (just as <i>you</i> do) about the table,
  were to be seen, here a mouse, there a beetle;
  here a spider,” (Lady Muriel shuddered) “there
  a wasp; here a toad, there a snake;” (“Father!”
  <span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
  said Lady Muriel, plaintively. “Did you hear
  <i>that</i>?”) “so we had plenty to talk about!”</p>
  <p>“And when you got stung——” the old lady
  began.</p>
  <p>“They were all chained-up, dear Madam!”</p>
  <p>And the old lady gave a satisfied nod.</p>
  <p>There was no silence to follow, <i>this</i> time.
  “Third Chapter!” Lady Muriel proclaimed at
  once, “Moving-Guests!”</p>
  <p>“Even the Wild-Creatures proved monotonous,”
  the orator proceeded. “So we left the
  guests to choose their own subjects; and, to
  avoid monotony, we changed <i>them</i>. We made
  the table of <i>two</i> rings; and the inner ring
  moved slowly round, all the time, along with
  the floor in the middle and the inner row of
  guests. Thus <i>every</i> inner guest was brought
  face-to-face with <i>every</i> outer guest. It was a
  little confusing, sometimes, to have to <i>begin</i> a
  story to one friend and <i>finish</i> it to another;
  but <i>every</i> plan has its faults, you know.”</p>
  <p>“Fourth Chapter!” Lady Muriel hastened
  to announce. “The Revolving-Humorist!”</p>
  <p>“For a <i>small</i> party we found it an excellent
  plan to have a round table, with a hole cut in
  <span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
  the middle large enough to hold <i>one</i> guest.
  Here we placed our <i>best</i> talker. He revolved
  slowly, facing every other guest in turn: and
  he told lively anecdotes the whole time!”</p>
  <p>“I shouldn’t like it!” murmured the pompous
  man. “It would make me giddy, revolving
  like that! I should decline to——” here it
  appeared to dawn upon him that perhaps the
  assumption he was making was not warranted
  by the circumstances: he took a hasty gulp of
  wine, and choked himself.</p>
  <p>But Mein Herr had relapsed into reverie,
  and made no further remark. Lady Muriel
  gave the signal, and the ladies left the room.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_147">147</div>
  <h2 id="c10">CHAPTER X.
  <br><span class="small">JABBERING AND JAM.</span></h2>
  <p>When the last lady had disappeared, and
  the Earl, taking his place at the head of the
  table, had issued the military order “Gentlemen!
  Close up the ranks, if you please!”,
  and when, in obedience to his command, we
  had gathered ourselves compactly round him,
  the pompous man gave a deep sigh of relief,
  filled his glass to the brim, pushed on the
  wine, and began one of his favorite orations.
  “They are charming, no doubt! Charming,
  but very frivolous. They drag us down, so
  to speak, to a lower level. They——”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_148">148</div>
  <p>“Do not all pronouns require antecedent
  <i>nouns</i>?” the Earl gently enquired.</p>
  <p>“Pardon me,” said the pompous man, with
  lofty condescension. “I had overlooked the
  noun. The ladies. We regret their absence.
  Yet we console ourselves. <i>Thought is free.</i>
  With them, we are limited to <i>trivial</i> topics—Art,
  Literature, Politics, and so forth. One
  can bear to discuss <i>such</i> paltry matters with
  a lady. But no man, in his senses—” (he
  looked sternly round the table, as if defying
  contradiction) “—ever yet discussed <i>WINE</i>
  with a lady!” He sipped his glass of port,
  leaned back in his chair, and slowly raised it
  up to his eye, so as to look through it at the
  lamp. “The vintage, my Lord?” he enquired,
  glancing at his host.</p>
  <p>The Earl named the date.</p>
  <p>“So I had supposed. But one likes to be
  certain. The <i>tint</i> is, perhaps, slightly pale.
  But the <i>body</i> is unquestionable. And as for
  the <i>bouquet</i>——”</p>
  <p>Ah, that magic Bouquet! How vividly
  that single word recalled the scene! The
  little beggar-boy turning his somersault in
  <span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
  the road—the sweet little crippled maiden in
  my arms—the mysterious evanescent nurse-maid—all
  rushed tumultuously into my mind,
  like the creatures of a dream: and through
  this mental haze there still boomed on, like
  the tolling of a bell, the solemn voice of the
  great connoisseur of <i>WINE</i>!</p>
  <p>Even <i>his</i> utterances had taken on themselves
  a strange and dream-like form. “No,” he
  resumed—and <i>why</i> is it, I pause to ask, that,
  in taking up the broken thread of a dialogue,
  one <i>always</i> begins with this cheerless monosyllable?
  After much anxious thought, I have
  come to the conclusion that the object in view
  is the same as that of the schoolboy, when the
  sum he is working has got into a hopeless
  muddle, and when in despair he takes the
  sponge, washes it all out, and begins again.
  Just in the same way the bewildered orator,
  by the simple process of denying <i>everything</i>
  that has been hitherto asserted, makes a clean
  sweep of the whole discussion, and can ‘start
  fair’ with a fresh theory. “No,” he resumed:
  “there’s nothing like cherry-jam, after all.
  That’s what <i>I</i> say!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_150">150</div>
  <p>“Not for <i>all</i> qualities!” an eager little man
  shrilly interposed. “For <i>richness</i> of general
  tone I don’t say that it <i>has</i> a rival. But for
  <i>delicacy</i> of modulation—for what one may call
  the ‘<i>harmonics</i>’ of flavour—give <i>me</i> good
  old <i>raspberry</i>-jam!”</p>
  <p>“Allow me one word!” The fat red-faced
  man, quite hoarse with excitement, broke into
  the dialogue. “It’s too important a question
  to be settled by Amateurs! I can give you
  the views of a <i>Professional</i>—perhaps the most
  experienced jam-taster now living. Why, I’ve
  known him fix the age of strawberry-jam, to
  a <i>day</i>—and we all know what a difficult jam
  it is to give a date to—on a single tasting!
  Well, I put to him the <i>very</i> question you are
  discussing. His words were ‘<i>cherry</i>-jam is
  best, for mere <i>chiaroscuro</i> of flavour: <i>raspberry</i>-jam
  lends itself best to those resolved discords
  that linger so lovingly on the tongue: but, for
  rapturous <i>utterness</i> of saccharine perfection, it’s
  <i>apricot-jam first and the rest nowhere</i>!’ That
  was well put, <i>wasn’t</i> it?”</p>
  <p>“Consummately put!” shrieked the eager
  little man.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_151">151</div>
  <p>“I know your friend well,” said the pompous
  man. “As a jam-taster, he has no rival! Yet
  I scarcely think——”</p>
  <p>But here the discussion became general: and
  his words were lost in a confused medley of
  names, every guest sounding the praises of his
  own favorite jam. At length, through the
  din, our host’s voice made itself heard. “Let
  us join the ladies!” These words seemed to
  recall me to waking life; and I felt sure that,
  for the last few minutes, I had relapsed into
  the ‘eerie’ state.</p>
  <p>“A strange dream!” I said to myself as we
  trooped upstairs. “Grown men discussing, as
  seriously as if they were matters of life and
  death, the hopelessly trivial details of mere
  <i>delicacies</i>, that appeal to no higher human
  function than the nerves of the tongue and
  palate! What a humiliating spectacle such a
  discussion would be in waking life!”</p>
  <p>When, on our way to the drawing-room, I
  received from the housekeeper my little friends,
  clad in the daintiest of evening costumes, and
  looking, in the flush of expectant delight, more
  radiantly beautiful than I had ever seen them
  <span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
  before, I felt no shock of surprise, but accepted
  the fact with the same unreasoning apathy with
  which one meets the events of a dream, and
  was merely conscious of a vague anxiety as to
  how they would acquit themselves in so novel
  a scene—forgetting that Court-life in Outland
  was as good training as they could need for
  Society in the more substantial world.</p>
  <p>It would be best, I thought, to introduce
  them as soon as possible to some good-natured
  lady-guest, and I selected the young lady whose
  piano-forte-playing had been so much talked of.
  “I am sure you like children,” I said. “May
  I introduce two little friends of mine? This is
  Sylvie—and this is Bruno.”</p>
  <p>The young lady kissed Sylvie very graciously.
  She would have done the same for <i>Bruno</i>, but
  he hastily drew back out of reach. “Their
  faces are new to me,” she said. “Where do
  you come from, my dear?”</p>
  <p>I had not anticipated so inconvenient a
  question; and, fearing that it might embarrass
  Sylvie, I answered for her. “They come from
  some distance. They are only here just for
  this one evening.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_153">153</div>
  <p>“How far have you come, dear?” the young
  lady persisted.</p>
  <p>Sylvie looked puzzled. “A mile or two, I
  <i>think</i>,” she said doubtfully.</p>
  <p>“A mile or <i>three</i>,” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“You shouldn’t say ‘a mile or <i>three</i>,’” Sylvie
  corrected him.</p>
  <p>The young lady nodded approval. “Sylvie’s
  quite right. It isn’t usual to say ‘a mile or
  <i>three</i>.’”</p>
  <p>“It would be usual—if we said it often
  enough,” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>It was the young lady’s turn to look puzzled
  now. “He’s very quick, for his age!” she
  murmured. “You’re not more than seven, are
  you, dear?” she added aloud.</p>
  <p>“I’m not so many as <i>that</i>,” said Bruno.
  “I’m <i>one</i>. Sylvie’s <i>one</i>. Sylvie and me is
  <i>two</i>. <i>Sylvie</i> taught me to count.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, I wasn’t <i>counting</i> you, you know!”
  the young lady laughingly replied.</p>
  <p>“Hasn’t oo <i>learnt</i> to count?” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>The young lady bit her lip. “Dear! What
  embarrassing questions he <i>does</i> ask!” she said
  in a half-audible ‘aside.’</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_154">154</div>
  <p>“Bruno, you shouldn’t!” Sylvie said reprovingly.</p>
  <p>“Shouldn’t <i>what</i>?” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“You shouldn’t ask—that sort of questions.”</p>
  <p>“<i>What</i> sort of questions?” Bruno mischievously
  persisted.</p>
  <p>“What <i>she</i> told you not,” Sylvie replied,
  with a shy glance at the young lady, and losing
  all sense of grammar in her confusion.</p>
  <p>“Oo ca’n’t pronounce it!” Bruno triumphantly
  cried. And he turned to the young lady,
  for sympathy in his victory. “I <i>knewed</i> she
  couldn’t pronounce ‘umbrella-sting’!”</p>
  <p>The young lady thought it best to return to
  the arithmetical problem. “When I asked if
  you were <i>seven</i>, you know, I didn’t mean
  ‘how many <i>children</i>?’ I meant ‘how many
  <i>years</i>——’”</p>
  <p>“Only got <i>two</i> ears,” said Bruno. “Nobody’s
  got <i>seven</i> ears.”</p>
  <p>“And you belong to this little girl?” the
  young lady continued, skilfully evading the
  anatomical problem.</p>
  <p>“No, I doosn’t belong to <i>her</i>!” said Bruno.
  “Sylvie belongs to <i>me</i>!” And he clasped
  <span class="pb" id="Page_155">155</span>
  his arms round her as he added “She are my
  very mine!”</p>
  <p>“And, do you know,” said the young lady,
  “I’ve a little sister at home, exactly like <i>your</i>
  sister? I’m sure they’d love each other.”</p>
  <p>“They’d be very extremely useful to each
  other,” Bruno said, thoughtfully. “And they
  wouldn’t want no looking-glasses to brush their
  hair wiz.”</p>
  <p>“Why not, my child?”</p>
  <p>“Why, each one would do for the other one’s
  looking-glass, a-course!” cried Bruno.</p>
  <p>But here Lady Muriel, who had been standing
  by, listening to this bewildering dialogue,
  interrupted it to ask if the young lady would
  favour us with some music; and the children
  followed their new friend to the piano.</p>
  <p>Arthur came and sat down by me. “If
  rumour speaks truly,” he whispered, “we are to
  have a real treat!” And then, amid a breathless
  silence, the performance began.</p>
  <p>She was one of those players whom Society
  talks of as ‘brilliant,’ and she dashed into the
  loveliest of Haydn’s Symphonies in a style that
  was clearly the outcome of years of patient
  <span class="pb" id="Page_156">156</span>
  study under the best masters. At first it
  seemed to be the perfection of piano-forte-playing;
  but in a few minutes I began to ask
  myself, wearily, “<i>What</i> is it that is wanting?
  <i>Why</i> does one get no pleasure from it?”</p>
  <p>Then I set myself to listen intently to
  every note; and the mystery explained itself.
  There <i>was</i> an almost-perfect mechanical <i>correctness</i>—and
  there was nothing else! False
  notes, of course, did not occur: she knew the
  piece too well for <i>that</i>; but there was just
  enough irregularity of <i>time</i> to betray that the
  player had no real ‘ear’ for music—just
  enough inarticulateness in the more elaborate
  passages to show that she did not think her
  audience worth taking real pains for—just
  enough mechanical monotony of accent to take
  all <i>soul</i> out of the heavenly modulations she
  was profaning—in short, it was simply irritating;
  and, when she had rattled off the finale
  and had struck the final chord as if, the instrument
  being now done with, it didn’t matter
  how many wires she broke, I could not even
  <i>affect</i> to join in the stereotyped “Oh, <i>thank</i>
  you!” which was chorused around me.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_157">157</div>
  <p>Lady Muriel joined us for a moment.
  “Isn’t it <i>beautiful</i>?” she whispered, to Arthur,
  with a mischievous smile.</p>
  <p>“No, it isn’t!” said Arthur. But the gentle
  sweetness of his face quite neutralised the
  apparent rudeness of the reply.</p>
  <p>“Such execution, you know!” she persisted.</p>
  <p>“That’s what she <i>deserves</i>,” Arthur doggedly
  replied: “but people are so prejudiced against
  capital——”</p>
  <p>“Now you’re beginning to talk nonsense!”
  Lady Muriel cried. “But you <i>do</i> like Music,
  don’t you? You said so just now.”</p>
  <p>“Do I like <i>Music</i>?” the Doctor repeated
  softly to himself. “My dear Lady Muriel,
  there is Music and Music. Your question is
  painfully vague. You might as well ask ‘Do
  you like <i>People</i>?’”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel bit her lip, frowned, and
  stamped with one tiny foot. As a dramatic
  representation of ill-temper, it was distinctly
  <i>not</i> a success. However, it took in <i>one</i> of her
  audience, and Bruno hastened to interpose, as
  peacemaker in a rising quarrel, with the remark
  “<i>I</i> likes Peoples!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_158">158</div>
  <p>Arthur laid a loving hand on the little curly
  head. “What? <i>All</i> Peoples?” he enquired.</p>
  <p>“Not <i>all</i> Peoples,” Bruno explained. “Only
  but Sylvie—and Lady Muriel—and him—”
  (pointing to the Earl) “and oo—and oo!”</p>
  <p>“You shouldn’t point at people,” said Sylvie.
  “It’s very rude.”</p>
  <p>“In Bruno’s World,” I said, “there are only
  <i>four</i> People—worth mentioning!”</p>
  <p>“In Bruno’s World!” Lady Muriel repeated
  thoughtfully. “A bright and flowery world.
  Where the grass is always green, where the
  breezes always blow softly, and the rain-clouds
  never gather; where there are no wild beasts,
  and no deserts——”</p>
  <p>“There <i>must</i> be deserts,” Arthur decisively
  remarked. “At least if it was <i>my</i> ideal world.”</p>
  <p>“But what possible use is there in a <i>desert</i>?”
  said Lady Muriel. “<i>Surely</i> you would have
  no wilderness in your ideal world?”</p>
  <p>Arthur smiled. “But indeed I <i>would</i>!” he
  said. “A wilderness would be more necessary
  than a railway; and <i>far</i> more conducive to
  general happiness than church-bells!”</p>
  <p>“But what would you use it for?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
  <p>“<i>To practise music in</i>,” he replied. “All the
  young ladies, that have no ear for music, but
  insist on learning it, should be conveyed,
  every morning, two or three miles into the
  wilderness. There each would find a comfortable
  room provided for her, and also a cheap
  second-hand piano-forte, on which she might
  play for hours, without adding one needless
  pang to the sum of human misery!”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel glanced round in alarm, lest
  these barbarous sentiments should be overheard.
  But the fair musician was at a safe
  distance. “At any rate you must allow that
  she’s a sweet girl?” she resumed.</p>
  <p>“Oh, certainly. As sweet as <i>eau sucrée</i>, if
  you choose—and nearly as interesting!”</p>
  <p>“You are incorrigible!” said Lady Muriel,
  and turned to me. “I hope you found Mrs.
  Mills an interesting companion?”</p>
  <p>“Oh, <i>that’s</i> her name, is it?” I said. “I
  fancied there was <i>more</i> of it.”</p>
  <p>“So there is: and it will be ‘at your proper
  peril’ (whatever that may mean) if you ever
  presume to address her as ‘Mrs. Mills.’ She
  is ‘Mrs. Ernest—Atkinson—Mills’!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_160">160</div>
  <p>“She is one of those would-be grandees,”
  said Arthur, “who think that, by tacking on to
  their surname all their spare Christian-names,
  with hyphens between, they can give it an
  aristocratic flavour. As if it wasn’t trouble
  enough to remember <i>one</i> surname!”</p>
  <p>By this time the room was getting crowded,
  as the guests, invited for the evening-party,
  were beginning to arrive, and Lady Muriel
  had to devote herself to the task of welcoming
  them, which she did with the sweetest grace
  imaginable. Sylvie and Bruno stood by her,
  deeply interested in the process.</p>
  <p>“I hope you like my friends?” she said to
  them. “Specially my dear old friend, Mein
  Herr (What’s become of him, I wonder?
  Oh, there he is!), that old gentleman in
  spectacles, with a long beard?”</p>
  <p>“He’s a grand old gentleman!” Sylvie said,
  gazing admiringly at ‘Mein Herr,’ who had
  settled down in a corner, from which his mild
  eyes beamed on us through a gigantic pair of
  spectacles. “And what a lovely beard!”</p>
  <p>“What does he call his-self?” Bruno
  whispered.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
  <p>“He calls himself ‘Mein Herr,’” Sylvie
  whispered in reply.</p>
  <p>Bruno shook his head impatiently. “That’s
  what he calls his <i>hair</i>, not his <i>self</i>, oo silly!”
  He appealed to me. “What doos he call his
  <i>self</i>, Mister Sir?”</p>
  <p>“That’s the only name <i>I</i> know of,” I said.
  “But he looks very lonely. Don’t you pity his
  grey hairs?”</p>
  <p>“I pities his <i>self</i>,” said Bruno, still harping
  on the misnomer; “but I doosn’t pity his
  <i>hair</i>, one bit. His <i>hair</i> ca’n’t feel!”</p>
  <p>“We met him this afternoon,” said Sylvie.
  “We’d been to see Nero, and we’d had <i>such</i>
  fun with him, making him invisible again!
  And we saw that nice old gentleman as we
  came back.”</p>
  <p>“Well, let’s go and talk to him, and cheer
  him up a little,” I said: “and perhaps we
  shall find out what he calls himself.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_162">162</div>
  <h2 id="c11">CHAPTER XI.
  <br><span class="small">THE MAN IN THE MOON.</span></h2>
  <p>The children came willingly. With one of
  them on each side of me, I approached the
  corner occupied by ‘Mein Herr.’ “You
  don’t object to <i>children</i>, I hope?” I began.</p>
  <p>“<i>Crabbed age and youth cannot live together!</i>”
  the old man cheerfully replied, with
  a most genial smile. “Now take a good look
  at me, my children! You would guess me to
  be an <i>old</i> man, wouldn’t you?”</p>
  <p>At first sight, though his face had reminded
  me so mysteriously of “the Professor,” he
  had seemed to be decidedly a <i>younger</i> man:
  <span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
  but, when I came to look into the wonderful
  depth of those large dreamy eyes, I felt,
  with a strange sense of awe, that he was incalculably
  <i>older</i>: he seemed to gaze at us
  out of some by-gone age, centuries away.</p>

  <p class="center small">MEIN HERR’S FAIRY-FRIENDS</p>
  </div>
  <p>“I don’t know if oo’re an <i>old</i> man,” Bruno
  answered, as the children, won over by the
  gentle voice, crept a little closer to him. “I
  thinks oo’re <i>eighty-three</i>.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_164">164</div>
  <p>“He is very exact!” said Mein Herr.</p>
  <p>“Is he anything like right?” I said.</p>
  <p>“There are reasons,” Mein Herr gently
  replied, “reasons which I am not at liberty
  to explain, for not mentioning <i>definitely</i> any
  Persons, Places, or Dates. One remark only
  I will permit myself to make—that the
  period of life, between the ages of a hundred-and-sixty-five
  and a hundred-and-seventy-five,
  is a specially <i>safe</i> one.”</p>
  <p>“How do you make that out?” I said.</p>
  <p>“Thus. You would consider swimming to
  be a very safe amusement, if you scarcely
  ever heard of any one dying of it. Am I
  not right in thinking that you never heard of
  any one dying between those two ages?”</p>
  <p>“I see what you mean,” I said: “but I’m
  afraid you ca’n’t prove <i>swimming</i> to be safe,
  on the same principle. It is no uncommon
  thing to hear of some one being <i>drowned</i>.”</p>
  <p>“In <i>my</i> country,” said Mein Herr, “no
  one is <i>ever</i> drowned.”</p>
  <p>“Is there no water deep enough?”</p>
  <p>“Plenty! But we ca’n’t <i>sink</i>. We are all
  <i>lighter than water</i>. Let me explain,” he added,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
  seeing my look of surprise. “Suppose you
  desire a race of <i>pigeons</i> of a particular shape
  or colour, do you not select, from year to
  year, those that are nearest to the shape or
  colour you want, and keep those, and part
  with the others?”</p>
  <p>“We do,” I replied. “We call it ‘Artificial
  Selection.’”</p>
  <p>“Exactly so,” said Mein Herr. “Well, <i>we</i>
  have practised that for some centuries—constantly
  selecting the <i>lightest</i> people: so that,
  now, <i>everybody</i> is lighter than water.”</p>
  <p>“Then you never can be drowned at <i>sea</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Never! It is only on the <i>land</i>—for instance,
  when attending a play in a theatre—that
  we are in such a danger.”</p>
  <p>“How can that happen at a <i>theatre</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Our theatres are all <i>underground</i>. Large
  tanks of water are placed above. If a fire
  breaks out, the taps are turned, and in one
  minute the theatre is flooded, up to the very
  roof! Thus the fire is extinguished.”</p>
  <p>“<i>And</i> the audience, I presume?”</p>
  <p>“That is a minor matter,” Mein Herr carelessly
  replied. “But they have the comfort of
  <span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
  knowing that, whether drowned or not, they
  are all <i>lighter than water</i>. We have not yet
  reached the standard of making people lighter
  than <i>air</i>: but we are <i>aiming</i> at it; and, in
  another thousand years or so——”</p>
  <p>“What doos oo do wiz the peoples that’s
  too heavy?” Bruno solemnly enquired.</p>
  <p>“We have applied the same process,” Mein
  Herr continued, not noticing Bruno’s question,
  “to many other purposes. We have
  gone on selecting <i>walking-sticks</i>—always
  keeping those that walked <i>best</i>—till we have
  obtained some, that can walk by themselves!
  We have gone on selecting <i>cotton-wool</i>, till we
  have got some lighter than air! You’ve no
  idea what a useful material it is! We call
  it ‘Imponderal.’”</p>
  <p>“What do you use it for?”</p>
  <p>“Well, chiefly for <i>packing</i> articles, to go
  by Parcel-Post. It makes them weigh <i>less
  than nothing</i>, you know.”</p>
  <p>“And how do the Post-Office people know
  what you have to pay?”</p>
  <p>“That’s the beauty of the new system!”
  Mein Herr cried exultingly. “They pay <i>us</i>:
  <span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
  we don’t pay <i>them</i>! I’ve often got as much
  as five shillings for sending a parcel.”</p>
  <p>“But doesn’t your Government object?”</p>
  <p>“Well, they <i>do</i> object, a little. They say
  it comes so expensive, in the long run. But
  the thing’s as clear as daylight, by their own
  rules. If I send a parcel, that weighs a
  pound <i>more</i> than nothing, I <i>pay</i> three-pence:
  so, of course, if it weighs a pound <i>less</i> than
  nothing, I ought to <i>receive</i> three-pence.”</p>
  <p>“It is <i>indeed</i> a useful article!” I said.</p>
  <p>“Yet even ‘Imponderal’ has its disadvantages,”
  he resumed. “I bought some, a few
  days ago, and put it into my <i>hat</i>, to carry it
  home, and the hat simply floated away!”</p>
  <p>“Had oo some of that funny stuff in oor hat
  <i>today</i>?” Bruno enquired. “Sylvie and me
  saw oo in the road, and oor hat were ever so
  high up! Weren’t it, Sylvie?”</p>
  <p>“No, that was quite another thing.” said
  Mein Herr. “There was a drop or two of
  rain falling: so I put my hat on the top of
  my stick—as an umbrella, you know. As I
  came along the road,” he continued, turning
  to me, “I was overtaken by——”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
  <p>“——a shower of rain?” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“Well, it <i>looked</i> more like the tail of a dog,”
  Mein Herr replied. “It was the most curious
  thing! Something rubbed affectionately against
  my knee. And I looked down. And I could
  see <i>nothing</i>! Only, about a yard off, there was
  a dog’s tail, wagging, all by itself!”</p>
  <p>“Oh, <i>Sylvie</i>!” Bruno murmured reproachfully.
  “Oo didn’t finish making him visible!”</p>
  <p>“I’m <i>so</i> sorry!” Sylvie said, looking very
  penitent. “I meant to rub it along his back,
  but we were in such a hurry. We’ll go and
  finish him tomorrow. Poor thing! Perhaps
  he’ll get no supper tonight!”</p>
  <p>“<i>Course</i> he won’t!” said Bruno. “Nobody
  never gives bones to a dog’s tail!”</p>
  <p>Mein Herr looked from one to the other in
  blank astonishment. “I do not understand
  you,” he said. “I had lost my way, and I was
  consulting a pocket-map, and somehow I had
  dropped one of my gloves, and this invisible
  <i>Something</i>, that had rubbed against my knee,
  actually brought it back to me!”</p>
  <p>“Course he did!” said Bruno. “He’s
  <i>welly</i> fond of fetching things.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
  <p>Mein Herr looked so thoroughly bewildered
  that I thought it best to change the subject.
  “What a useful thing a pocket-map is!” I
  remarked.</p>
  <p>“That’s another thing we’ve learned from
  <i>your</i> Nation,” said Mein Herr, “map-making.
  But we’ve carried it much further than <i>you</i>.
  What do you consider the <i>largest</i> map that
  would be really useful?”</p>
  <p>“About six inches to the mile.”</p>
  <p>“Only <i>six inches</i>!” exclaimed Mein Herr.
  “We very soon got to six <i>yards</i> to the mile.
  Then we tried a <i>hundred</i> yards to the mile.
  And then came the grandest idea of all! We
  actually made a map of the country, on the
  scale of <i>a mile to the mile</i>!”</p>
  <p>“Have you used it much?” I enquired.</p>
  <p>“It has never been spread out, yet,” said
  Mein Herr: “the farmers objected: they said
  it would cover the whole country, and shut out
  the sunlight! So we now use the country itself,
  as its own map, and I assure you it does
  nearly as well. Now let me ask you <i>another</i>
  question. What is the smallest <i>world</i> you
  would care to inhabit?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_170">170</div>
  <p>“<i>I</i> know!” cried Bruno, who was listening
  intently. “I’d like a little teeny-tiny world,
  just big enough for Sylvie and me!”</p>
  <p>“Then you would have to stand on opposite
  sides of it,” said Mein Herr. “And so you
  would never see your sister <i>at all</i>!”</p>
  <p>“And I’d have no <i>lessons</i>,” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“You don’t mean to say you’ve been trying
  experiments in <i>that</i> direction!” I said.</p>
  <p>“Well, not <i>experiments</i> exactly. We do not
  profess to <i>construct</i> planets. But a scientific
  friend of mine, who has made several balloon-voyages,
  assures me he has visited a planet so
  small that he could walk right round it in
  twenty minutes! There had been a great
  battle, just before his visit, which had ended
  rather oddly: the vanquished army ran away
  at full speed, and in a very few minutes found
  themselves face-to-face with the victorious
  army, who were marching home again, and
  who were so frightened at finding themselves
  between <i>two</i> armies, that they surrendered at
  once! Of course that lost them the battle,
  though, as a matter of fact, they had killed <i>all</i>
  the soldiers on the other side.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
  <p>“Killed soldiers <i>ca’n’t</i> run away,” Bruno
  thoughtfully remarked.</p>
  <p>“‘Killed’ is a technical word,” replied Mein
  Herr. “In the little planet I speak of, the
  bullets were made of soft black stuff, which
  marked everything it touched. So, after a
  battle, all you had to do was to count how
  many soldiers on each side were ‘killed’—that
  means ‘marked on the <i>back</i>,’ for marks in
  <i>front</i> didn’t count.”</p>
  <p>“Then you couldn’t ‘kill’ any, unless they
  ran away?” I said.</p>
  <p>“My scientific friend found out a better
  plan than <i>that</i>. He pointed out that, if only
  the bullets were sent <i>the other way round the
  world</i>, they would hit the enemy in the <i>back</i>.
  After that, the <i>worst</i> marksmen were considered
  the <i>best</i> soldiers; and <i>the very worst of
  all</i> always got First Prize.”</p>
  <p>“And how did you decide which was <i>the
  very worst of all</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Easily. The <i>best</i> possible shooting is, you
  know, to hit what is exactly in <i>front</i> of you:
  so of course the <i>worst</i> possible is to hit what
  is exactly <i>behind</i> you.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_172">172</div>
  <p>“They were strange people in that little
  planet!” I said.</p>
  <p>“They were indeed! Perhaps their method
  of <i>government</i> was the strangest of all. In
  <i>this</i> planet, I am told, a Nation consists of a
  number of Subjects, and one King: but, in
  the little planet I speak of, it consisted of a
  number of <i>Kings</i>, and one <i>Subject</i>!”</p>
  <p>“You say you are ‘told’ what happens in
  <i>this</i> planet,” I said. “May I venture to guess
  that you yourself are a visitor from some <i>other</i>
  planet?”</p>
  <p>Bruno clapped his hands in his excitement.
  “Is oo the Man-in-the-Moon?” he cried.</p>
  <p>Mein Herr looked uneasy. “I am <i>not</i> in
  the Moon, my child,” he said evasively. “To
  return to what I was saying. I think <i>that</i>
  method of government ought to answer <i>well</i>.
  You see, the Kings would be sure to make
  Laws contradicting each other: so the Subject
  could never be punished, because, <i>whatever</i> he
  did, he’d be obeying <i>some</i> Law.”</p>
  <p>“And, whatever he did, he’d be <i>dis</i>obeying
  <i>some</i> Law!” cried Bruno. “So he’d <i>always</i>
  be punished!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_173">173</div>
  <p>Lady Muriel was passing at the moment, and
  caught the last word. “Nobody’s going to
  be punished <i>here</i>!” she said, taking Bruno
  in her arms. “This is Liberty-Hall! Would
  you lend me the children for a minute?”</p>
  <p>“The children desert us, you see,” I said to
  Mein Herr, as she carried them off: “so we
  old folk must keep each other company!”</p>
  <p>The old man sighed. “Ah, well! We’re old
  folk <i>now</i>; and yet I was a child myself, once—at
  least I fancy so.”</p>
  <p>It <i>did</i> seem a rather unlikely fancy, I could
  not help owning to myself—looking at the
  shaggy white hair, and the long beard—that
  he could <i>ever</i> have been a child. “You are
  fond of young people?” I said.</p>
  <p>“Young <i>men</i>,” he replied. “Not of <i>children</i>
  exactly. I used to teach young men—many
  a year ago—in my dear old University!”</p>
  <p>“I didn’t quite catch its <i>name</i>?” I hinted.</p>
  <p>“I did not name it,” the old man replied
  mildly. “Nor would you know the name if I
  did. Strange tales I could tell you of all the
  changes I have witnessed there! But it would
  weary you, I fear.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_174">174</div>
  <p>“No, <i>indeed</i>!” I said. “Pray go on. What
  kind of changes?”</p>
  <p>But the old man seemed to be more in a
  humour for questions than for answers. “Tell
  me,” he said, laying his hand impressively on
  my arm, “tell me something. For I am a
  stranger in your land, and I know little of <i>your</i>
  modes of education: yet something tells me
  <i>we</i> are further on than <i>you</i> in the eternal cycle
  of change—and that many a theory <i>we</i> have
  tried and found to fail, <i>you</i> also will try, with
  a wilder enthusiasm: you also will find to fail,
  with a bitterer despair!”</p>
  <p>It was strange to see how, as he talked, and
  his words flowed more and more freely, with a
  certain rhythmic eloquence, his features seemed
  to glow with an inner light, and the whole man
  seemed to be transformed, as if he had grown
  fifty years younger in a moment of time.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
  <h2 id="c12">CHAPTER XII.
  <br><span class="small">FAIRY-MUSIC.</span></h2>
  <p>The silence that ensued was broken by the
  voice of the musical young lady, who had seated
  herself near us, and was conversing with one of
  the newly-arrived guests. “Well!” she said in
  a tone of scornful surprise. “We <i>are</i> to have
  something new in the way of music, it appears!”</p>
  <p>I looked round for an explanation, and was
  nearly as much astonished as the speaker herself:
  it was <i>Sylvie</i> whom Lady Muriel was
  leading to the piano!</p>
  <p>“Do try it, my darling!” she was saying.
  “I’m sure you can play very nicely!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
  <p>Sylvie looked round at me, with tears in her
  eyes. I tried to give her an encouraging
  smile, but it was evidently a great strain on the
  nerves of a child so wholly unused to be made
  an exhibition of, and she was frightened and
  unhappy. Yet here came out the perfect sweetness
  of her disposition: I could see that she
  was resolved to forget herself, and do her best
  to give pleasure to Lady Muriel and her friends.
  She seated herself at the instrument, and began
  instantly. Time and expression, so far as one
  could judge, were perfect: but her touch was
  one of such extraordinary lightness that it was
  at first scarcely possible, through the hum of
  conversation which still continued, to catch a
  note of what she was playing.</p>
  <p>But in a minute the hum had died away into
  absolute silence, and we all sat, entranced and
  breathless, to listen to such heavenly music as
  none then present could ever forget.</p>
  <p>Hardly touching the notes at first, she played
  a sort of introduction in a minor key—like an
  embodied twilight; one felt as though the lights
  were growing dim, and a mist were creeping
  through the room. Then there flashed through
  <span class="pb" id="Page_177">177</span>
  the gathering gloom the first few notes of a
  melody so lovely, so delicate, that one held
  one’s breath, fearful to lose a single note of it.
  Ever and again the music dropped into the
  pathetic minor key with which it had begun,
  and, each time that the melody forced its way,
  so to speak, through the enshrouding gloom
  into the light of day, it was more entrancing,
  more magically sweet. Under the airy touch
  of the child, the instrument actually seemed
  to <i>warble</i>, like a bird. “<i>Rise up, my love, my
  fair one</i>,” it seemed to sing, “<i>and come away!
  For lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and
  gone; the flowers appear on the earth; the time
  of the singing of birds is come!</i>” One could
  fancy one heard the tinkle of the last few
  drops, shaken from the trees by a passing
  gust—that one saw the first glittering rays
  of the sun, breaking through the clouds.</p>
  <p>The Count hurried across the room in great
  excitement. “I <i>cannot</i> remember myself,” he
  exclaimed, “of the name of this so charming
  an air! It is of an opera, most surely. Yet
  not even will the <i>opera</i> remind his name to
  me! What you call him, dear child?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_178">178</div>
  <div class="img" id="fig13">
  <img alt="‘HOW CALL YOU THE OPERA?’" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i178.jpg" id="id-5012048276311256761" width="500" height="440">
  <p class="center small">‘HOW CALL YOU THE OPERA?’</p>
  </div>
  <p>Sylvie looked round at him with a rapt expression
  of face. She had ceased playing, but
  her fingers still wandered fitfully over the keys.
  All fear and shyness had quite passed away
  now, and nothing remained but the pure joy
  of the music that had thrilled our hearts.</p>
  <p>“The title of it!” the Count repeated impatiently.
  “How call you the opera?”</p>
  <p>“I don’t know what an opera <i>is</i>,” Sylvie
  half-whispered.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
  <p>“How, then, call you the <i>air</i>?”</p>
  <p>“I don’t know any name for it,” Sylvie
  replied, as she rose from the instrument.</p>
  <p>“But this is marvellous!” exclaimed the
  Count, following the child, and addressing
  himself to me, as if I were the proprietor of
  this musical prodigy, and so <i>must</i> know the
  origin of her music. “You have heard her
  play this, sooner—I would say ‘before this
  occasion’? How call you the air?”</p>
  <p>I shook my head; but was saved from more
  questions by Lady Muriel, who came up to
  petition the Count for a song.</p>
  <p>The Count spread out his hands apologetically,
  and ducked his head. “But, Milady, I
  have already respected—I would say prospected—all
  your songs; and there shall be
  none fitted to my voice! They are not for
  basso voices!”</p>
  <p>“Wo’n’t you look at them again?” Lady
  Muriel implored.</p>
  <p>“Let’s help him!” Bruno whispered to
  Sylvie. “Let’s get him—<i>you</i> know!”</p>
  <p>Sylvie nodded. “Shall <i>we</i> look for a song
  for you?” she said sweetly to the Count.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_180">180</div>
  <p>“Mais <i>oui</i>!” the little man exclaimed.</p>
  <p>“Of course we may!” said Bruno, while,
  each taking a hand of the delighted Count,
  they led him to the music-stand.</p>
  <p>“There is still hope!” said Lady Muriel
  over her shoulder, as she followed them.</p>
  <p>I turned to ‘Mein Herr,’ hoping to resume
  our interrupted conversation. “You were remarking——”
  I began: but at this moment
  Sylvie came to call Bruno, who had returned
  to my side, looking unusually serious. “<i>Do</i>
  come, Bruno!” she entreated. “You know
  we’ve nearly found it!” Then, in a whisper,
  “The locket’s in my <i>hand</i>, now. I couldn’t
  get it out while they were looking!”</p>
  <p>But Bruno drew back. “The man called
  me names,” he said with dignity.</p>
  <p>“What names?” I enquired with some
  curiosity.</p>
  <p>“I asked him,” said Bruno, “which sort of
  song he liked. And he said ‘<i>A</i> song of <i>a</i>
  man, not of <i>a</i> lady.’ And I said ‘Shall Sylvie
  and me find you the song of Mister Tottles?’
  And he said ‘Wait, eel!’ And I’m
  <i>not</i> an eel, oo know!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
  <p>“I’m <i>sure</i> he didn’t mean it!” Sylvie said
  earnestly. “It’s something French—you
  know he ca’n’t talk English so well as——”</p>
  <p>Bruno relented visibly. “Course he knows
  no better, if he’s Flench! Flenchmen <i>never</i>
  can speak English so goodly as <i>us</i>!” And
  Sylvie led him away, a willing captive.</p>
  <p>“Nice children!” said the old man, taking
  off his spectacles and rubbing them carefully.
  Then he put them on again, and watched with
  an approving smile, while the children tossed
  over the heap of music, and we just caught
  Sylvie’s reproving words, “We’re <i>not</i> making
  hay, Bruno!”</p>
  <p>“This has been a long interruption to our
  conversation,” I said. “Pray let us go on!”</p>
  <p>“Willingly!” replied the gentle old man.</p>
  <p>“I was much interested in what you——”
  He paused a moment, and passed his hand
  uneasily across his brow. “One forgets,” he
  murmured. “What was I saying? Oh! Something
  you were to tell me. Yes. Which of
  your teachers do you value the most highly,
  those whose words are easily understood, or
  those who puzzle you at every turn?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
  <p>I felt obliged to admit that we generally
  admired most the teachers we couldn’t quite
  understand.</p>
  <p>“Just so,” said Mein Herr. “That’s the
  way it begins. Well, <i>we</i> were at that stage
  some eighty years ago—or was it ninety? Our
  favourite teacher got more obscure every year;
  and every year we admired him more—just
  as <i>your</i> Art-fanciers call <i>mist</i> the fairest feature
  in a landscape, and admire a view with frantic
  delight when they can see nothing! Now I’ll
  tell you how it ended. It was Moral Philosophy
  that our idol lectured on. Well, his pupils
  couldn’t make head or tail of it, but they got
  it all by heart; and, when Examination-time
  came, they wrote it down; and the Examiners
  said ‘Beautiful! What depth!’”</p>
  <p>“But what good was it to the young men
  <i>afterwards</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Why, don’t you see?” replied Mein Herr.
  “<i>They</i> became teachers in their turn, and <i>they</i>
  said all these things over again; and <i>their</i>
  pupils wrote it all down; and the Examiners
  accepted it; and nobody had the ghost of an
  idea what it all meant!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_183">183</div>
  <p>“And how did it end?”</p>
  <p>“It ended this way. We woke up one fine
  day, and found there was no one in the place
  that knew <i>anything</i> about Moral Philosophy.
  So we abolished it, teachers, classes, examiners,
  and all. And if any one wanted to learn anything
  about it, he had to make it out for
  himself; and after another twenty years or so
  there were several men that really knew something
  about it! Now tell me another thing.
  How long do you teach a youth before you
  examine him, in your Universities?”</p>
  <p>I told him, three or four years.</p>
  <p>“Just so, just what <i>we</i> did!” he exclaimed.
  “We taught ’em a bit, and, just as they were
  beginning to take it in, we took it all out again!
  We pumped our wells dry before they were a
  quarter full—we stripped our orchards while
  the apples were still in blossom—we applied
  the severe logic of arithmetic to our chickens,
  while peacefully slumbering in their shells!
  Doubtless it’s the early bird that picks up the
  worm—but if the bird gets up so outrageously
  early that the worm is still deep underground,
  what <i>then</i> is its chance of a breakfast?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
  <p>Not much, I admitted.</p>
  <p>“Now see how that works!” he went on
  eagerly. “If you want to pump your wells
  so soon—and I suppose you tell me that is
  what you <i>must</i> do?”</p>
  <p>“We must,” I said. “In an over-crowded
  country like this, nothing but Competitive
  Examinations——”</p>
  <p>Mein Herr threw up his hands wildly.
  “What, <i>again</i>?” he cried. “I thought it was
  dead, fifty years ago! Oh this Upas tree of
  Competitive Examinations! Beneath whose
  deadly shade all the original genius, all the
  exhaustive research, all the untiring life-long
  diligence by which our fore-fathers have so
  advanced human knowledge, must slowly but
  surely wither away, and give place to a system
  of Cookery, in which the human mind is
  a sausage, and all we ask is, how much indigestible
  stuff can be crammed into it!”</p>
  <p>Always, after these bursts of eloquence, he
  seemed to forget himself for a moment, and
  only to hold on to the thread of thought by
  some single word. “Yes, <i>crammed</i>,” he repeated.
  “We went through all that stage of
  <span class="pb" id="Page_185">185</span>
  the disease—had it bad, I warrant you! Of
  course, as the Examination was all in all, we
  tried to put in just what was wanted—and the
  <i>great</i> thing to aim at was, that the Candidate
  should know absolutely <i>nothing</i> beyond the
  needs of the Examination! I don’t say it was
  ever <i>quite</i> achieved: but one of my own pupils
  (pardon an old man’s egotism) came very near
  it. After the Examination, he mentioned to
  me the few facts which he knew but had <i>not</i>
  been able to bring in, and I can assure you
  they were trivial, Sir, absolutely trivial!”</p>
  <p>I feebly expressed my surprise and delight.</p>
  <p>The old man bowed, with a gratified smile,
  and proceeded. “At that time, no one had
  hit on the much more rational plan of watching
  for the individual scintillations of genius,
  and rewarding them as they occurred. As it
  was, we made our unfortunate pupil into a
  Leyden-jar, charged him up to the eyelids—then
  applied the knob of a Competitive Examination,
  and drew off one magnificent spark,
  which very often cracked the jar! What
  mattered <i>that</i>? We labeled it ‘First Class
  Spark,’ and put it away on the shelf.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_186">186</div>
  <p>“But the more rational system——?” I
  suggested.</p>
  <p>“Ah, yes! <i>that</i> came next. Instead of
  giving the whole reward of learning in one
  lump, we used to pay for every good answer as
  it occurred. How well I remember lecturing
  in those days, with a heap of small coins at my
  elbow! It was ‘A <i>very</i> good answer, Mr.
  Jones!’ (that meant a shilling, mostly). ‘Bravo,
  Mr. Robinson!’ (that meant half-a-crown).
  Now I’ll tell you how <i>that</i> worked. Not one
  single fact would any of them take in, without
  a fee! And when a clever boy came up from
  school, he got paid more for learning than we
  got paid for teaching him! Then came the
  wildest craze of all.”</p>
  <p>“What, <i>another</i> craze?” I said.</p>
  <p>“It’s the last one,” said the old man. “I
  must have tired you out with my long story.
  Each College wanted to get the clever boys:
  so we adopted a system which we had heard
  was very popular in England: the Colleges
  competed against each other, and the boys
  let themselves out to the highest bidder!
  What geese we were! Why, they were bound
  <span class="pb" id="Page_187">187</span>
  to come to the University <i>somehow</i>. We
  needn’t have paid ’em! And all our money
  went in getting clever boys to come to one
  College rather than another! The competition
  was so keen, that at last mere money-payments
  were not enough. Any College, that wished
  to secure some specially clever young man,
  had to waylay him at the Station, and hunt
  him through the streets. The first who
  touched him was allowed to have him.”</p>
  <p>“That hunting-down of the scholars, as they
  arrived, must have been a curious business,”
  I said. “Could you give me some idea of
  what it was like?”</p>
  <p>“Willingly!” said the old man. “I will
  describe to you the very last Hunt that took
  place, before that form of Sport (for it was
  actually reckoned among the <i>Sports</i> of the
  day: we called it ‘Cub-Hunting’) was finally
  abandoned. I witnessed it myself, as I happened
  to be passing by at the moment, and
  was what we called ‘in at the death.’ I can
  see it now!” he went on in an excited tone,
  gazing into vacancy with those large dreamy
  eyes of his. “It seems like yesterday; and
  <span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
  yet it happened——” He checked himself
  hastily, and the remaining words died away
  into a whisper.</p>

  <p>“<i>Many</i> years ago,” he replied. “The scene
  at the Railway-Station had been (so they told
  me) one of wild excitement. Eight or nine
  Heads of Colleges had assembled at the gates
  (no one was allowed inside), and the Station-Master
  had drawn a line on the pavement,
  and insisted on their all standing behind it.
  The gates were flung open! The young man
  darted through them, and fled like lightning
  down the street, while the Heads of Colleges
  actually <i>yelled</i> with excitement on catching
  sight of him! The Proctor gave the word,
  in the old statutory form, ‘<i>Semel!</i> <i>Bis!</i> <i>Ter!</i>
  <i>Currite!</i>’, and the Hunt began! Oh, it was
  a fine sight, believe me! At the first corner
  he dropped his Greek Lexicon: further on,
  his railway-rug: then various small articles:
  <span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
  then his umbrella: lastly, what I suppose he
  prized most, his hand-bag: but the game was
  up: the spherical Principal of—of——”</p>
  <p>“Of <i>which</i> College?” I said.</p>
  <p>“—of <i>one</i> of the Colleges,” he resumed,
  “had put into operation the Theory—his own
  discovery—of Accelerated Velocity, and captured
  him just opposite to where I stood. I
  shall never forget that wild breathless struggle!
  But it was soon over. Once in those great
  bony hands, escape was impossible!”</p>
  <p>“May I ask why you speak of him as the
  ‘<i>spherical</i>’ Principal?” I said.</p>
  <p>“The epithet referred to his <i>shape</i>, which
  was a perfect <i>sphere</i>. You are aware that
  a bullet, another instance of a perfect sphere,
  when falling in a perfectly straight line, moves
  with Accelerated Velocity?”</p>
  <p>I bowed assent.</p>
  <p>“Well, my spherical friend (as I am proud
  to call him) set himself to investigate the
  <i>causes</i> of this. He found them to be <i>three</i>.
  One; that it is a perfect <i>sphere</i>. Two; that
  it moves in a <i>straight line</i>. Three; that its
  direction is <i>not upwards</i>. When these three
  <span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
  conditions are fulfilled, you get Accelerated
  Velocity.”</p>
  <p>“Hardly,” I said: “if you will excuse my
  differing from you. Suppose we apply the
  theory to <i>horizontal</i> motion. If a bullet is
  fired <i>horizontally</i>, it——”</p>
  <p>“—it does <i>not</i> move in a <i>straight line</i>,”
  he quietly finished my sentence for me.</p>
  <p>“I yield the point,” I said. “What did
  your friend do next?”</p>
  <p>“The next thing was to apply the theory,
  as you rightly suggest, to <i>horizontal</i> motion.
  But the moving body, ever tending to <i>fall</i>,
  needs <i>constant support</i>, if it is to move in a
  true horizontal line. ‘What, then,’ he asked
  himself, ‘will <i>give constant support to a moving
  body</i>?’ And his answer was ‘<i>Human
  legs!</i>’ <i>That</i> was the discovery that immortalised
  his name!”</p>
  <p>“His name being——?” I suggested.</p>
  <p>“I had not mentioned it,” was the gentle
  reply of my most unsatisfactory informant.
  “His next step was an obvious one. He
  took to a diet of suet-dumplings, until his
  body had become a perfect sphere. <i>Then</i>
  <span class="pb" id="Page_192">192</span>
  he went out for his first experimental run—which
  nearly cost him his life!”</p>
  <p>“How was <i>that</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Well, you see, he had no idea of the <i>tremendous</i>
  new Force in Nature that he was
  calling into play. He began too fast. In a
  very few minutes he found himself moving at
  a hundred miles an hour! And, if he had
  not had the presence of mind to charge into
  the middle of a haystack (which he scattered
  to the four winds) there can be no doubt that
  he would have left the Planet he belonged to,
  and gone right away into Space!”</p>
  <p>“And how came that to be the <i>last</i> of the
  Cub-Hunts?” I enquired.</p>
  <p>“Well, you see, it led to a rather scandalous
  dispute between two of the Colleges.
  <i>Another</i> Principal had laid his hand on the
  young man, so nearly at the same moment
  as the <i>spherical</i> one, that there was no knowing
  which had touched him first. The dispute
  got into print, and did us no credit, and, in
  short, Cub-Hunts came to an end. Now I’ll
  tell you what cured us of that wild craze of
  ours, the bidding against each other, for the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
  clever scholars, just as if they were articles
  to be sold by auction! Just when the craze
  had reached its highest point, and when one
  of the Colleges had actually advertised a
  Scholarship of one thousand pounds <i>per
  annum</i>, one of our tourists brought us the
  manuscript of an old African legend—I
  happen to have a copy of it in my pocket.
  Shall I translate it for you?”</p>
  <p>“Pray go on,” I said, though I felt I was
  getting <i>very</i> sleepy.</p>

  <br><span class="small">WHAT TOTTLES MEANT.</span></h2>
  <p>Mein Herr unrolled the manuscript, but, to
  my great surprise, instead of <i>reading</i> it, he
  began to <i>sing</i> it, in a rich mellow voice that
  seemed to ring through the room.</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“One thousand pounds per annuum</p>
  <p class="t0">Is not so bad a figure, come!”</p>
  <p class="t0">Cried Tottles. “And I tell you, flat,</p>
  <p class="t0">A man may marry well on that!</p>
  <p class="t0">To say ‘the Husband needs the Wife’</p>
  <p class="t0">Is not the way to represent it.</p>
  <p class="t0">The crowning joy of Woman’s life</p>

  </div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">‘Contented with a frugal lot’</p>

  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_196">196</div>
  <p>Here, with one of those convulsive starts
  that wake one up in the very act of dropping
  off to sleep, I became conscious that the deep
  musical tones that thrilled me did <i>not</i> belong
  to Mein Herr, but to the French Count. The
  old man was still conning the manuscript.</p>
  <p>“I <i>beg</i> your pardon for keeping you waiting!”
  he said. “I was just making sure that
  I knew the English for all the words. I am
  quite ready now.” And he read me the following
  Legend:—</p>
  <p>“In a city that stands in the very centre
  of Africa, and is rarely visited by the casual
  tourist, the people had always bought eggs—a
  daily necessary in a climate where egg-flip
  was the usual diet—from a Merchant who
  came to their gates once a week. And the
  people always bid wildly against each other:
  so there was quite a lively auction every time
  the Merchant came, and the last egg in his
  basket used to fetch the value of two or three
  camels, or thereabouts. And eggs got dearer
  every week. And still they drank their egg-flip,
  and wondered where all their money
  went to.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>

  <p class="center small">THE EGG-MERCHANT</p>
  </div>
  <p>“And there came a day when they put their
  heads together. And they understood what
  donkeys they had been.</p>
  <p>“And next day, when the Merchant came,
  only <i>one</i> Man went forth. And he said ‘Oh,
  thou of the hook-nose and the goggle-eyes,
  thou of the measureless beard, how much for
  that lot of eggs?’</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_198">198</div>
  <p>“And the Merchant answered him ‘I <i>could</i>
  let thee have that lot at ten thousand piastres
  the dozen.’</p>
  <p>“And the Man chuckled inwardly, and said
  ‘<i>Ten</i> piastres the dozen I offer thee, and no
  more, oh descendant of a distinguished grandfather!’</p>
  <p>“And the Merchant stroked his beard, and
  said ‘Hum! I will await the coming of thy
  friends,’ So he waited. And the Man waited
  with him. And they waited both together.”</p>
  <p>“The manuscript breaks off here,” said
  Mein Herr, as he rolled it up again; “but
  it was enough to open our eyes. We saw
  what simpletons we had been—buying our
  Scholars much as those ignorant savages
  bought their eggs—and the ruinous system
  was abandoned. If only we could have abandoned,
  along with it, all the <i>other</i> fashions we
  had borrowed from you, instead of carrying
  them to their logical results! But it was not
  to be. What ruined my country, and drove
  me from my home, was the introduction—into
  the <i>Army</i>, of all places—of your theory
  of Political Dichotomy!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>
  <p>“Shall I trouble you too much,” I said, “if
  I ask you to explain what you mean by ‘the
  Theory of Political Dichotomy’?”</p>
  <p>“No trouble at all!” was Mein Herr’s most
  courteous reply. “I quite enjoy talking, when
  I get so good a listener. What started the
  thing, with us, was the report brought to us,
  by one of our most eminent statesmen, who
  had stayed some time in England, of the way
  affairs were managed there. It was a political
  necessity (so he assured us, and we believed
  him, though we had never discovered it till
  that moment) that there should be <i>two</i> Parties,
  in every affair and on every subject. In
  <i>Politics</i>, the two Parties, which you had found
  it necessary to institute, were called, he told
  us, ‘Whigs’ and ‘Tories’.”</p>
  <p>“That must have been some time ago?”
  I remarked.</p>
  <p>“It <i>was</i> some time ago,” he admitted.
  “And this was the way the affairs of the
  British Nation were managed. (You will
  correct me if I misrepresent it. I do but
  repeat what our traveler told us.) These
  two Parties—which were in chronic hostility
  <span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
  to each other—took turns in conducting the
  Government; and the Party, that happened
  <i>not</i> to be in power, was called the ‘Opposition’,
  I believe?”</p>
  <p>“That is the right name,” I said. “There
  have always been, so long as we have had a
  Parliament at all, <i>two</i> Parties, one ‘in’, and
  one ‘out’.”</p>
  <p>“Well, the function of the ‘Ins’ (if I may
  so call them) was to do the best they could
  for the national welfare—in such things as
  making war or peace, commercial treaties, and
  so forth?”</p>
  <p>“Undoubtedly,” I said.</p>
  <p>“And the function of the ‘Outs’ was (so
  our traveller assured us, though we were very
  incredulous at first) to <i>prevent</i> the ‘Ins’ from
  succeeding in any of these things?”</p>
  <p>“To <i>criticize</i> and to <i>amend</i> their proceedings,”
  I corrected him. “It would be <i>unpatriotic</i>
  to <i>hinder</i> the Government in doing
  what was for the good of the Nation! We
  have always held a <i>Patriot</i> to be the greatest
  of heroes, and an <i>unpatriotic</i> spirit to be one
  of the worst of human ills!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_201">201</div>
  <p>“Excuse me for a moment,” the old gentleman
  courteously replied, taking out his pocket-book.
  “I have a few memoranda here, of a
  correspondence I had with our tourist, and,
  if you will allow me, I’ll just refresh my memory—although
  I quite agree with you—it
  is, as you say, one of the worst of human
  ills—” And, here Mein Herr began singing
  again:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">But oh, the worst of human ills</p>
  <p class="t0">(Poor Tottles found) are ‘little bills’!</p>
  <p class="t0">And, with no balance in the Bank,</p>
  <p class="t0">What wonder that his spirits sank?</p>
  <p class="t0">Still, as the money flowed away,</p>
  <p class="t0">He wondered how on earth she spent it.</p>
  <p class="t0">“You cost me twenty pounds a day,</p>
  <p class="t0"><span class="norm">At least</span>!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">She sighed. “Those Drawing Rooms, you know!</p>
  <p class="t0">I really never thought about it:</p>
  <p class="t0">Mamma declared we ought to go—</p>
  <p class="t0">We should be Nobodies without it.</p>
  <p class="t0">That diamond-circlet for my brow—</p>
  <p class="t0">I quite believed that <span class="norm">she</span> had sent it,</p>
  <p class="t0">Until the Bill came in just now——”</p>
  <p class="t0">“<span class="norm">Viper</span>!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_202">202</div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">Poor Mrs. T. could bear no more,</p>
  <p class="t0">But fainted flat upon the floor.</p>
  <p class="t0">Mamma-in-law, with anguish wild,</p>
  <p class="t0">Seeks, all in vain, to rouse her child.</p>
  <p class="t0">“Quick! Take this box of smelling-salts!</p>
  <p class="t0">Don’t scold her, James, or you’ll repent it,</p>
  <p class="t0">She’s a <span class="norm">dear</span> girl, with all her faults——”</p>
  <p class="t0">“She <span class="norm">is</span>!” groaned Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“I was a donkey,” Tottles cried,</p>
  <p class="t0">“To choose your daughter for my bride!</p>
  <p class="t0">’Twas <span class="norm">you</span> that bid us cut a dash!</p>
  <p class="t0">’Tis <span class="norm">you</span> have brought us to this smash!</p>
  <p class="t0">You don’t suggest one single thing</p>
  <p class="t0">That can in any way prevent it——</p>
  <p class="t0">Then what’s the use of arguing?</p>
  <p class="t0"><span class="norm">Shut up!</span>” cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
  </div>
  <p>Once more I started into wakefulness, and
  realised that Mein Herr was not the singer.
  He was still consulting his memoranda.</p>
  <p>“It is exactly what my friend told me,” he
  resumed, after conning over various papers.
  “‘<i>Unpatriotic</i>’ is the very word I had used,
  in writing to him, and ‘<i>hinder</i>’ is the very
  word he used in his reply! Allow me to read
  you a portion of his letter:——</p>
  <blockquote><div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_203">203</div>
  <p>“‘<i>I can assure you</i>,’ he writes, ‘<i>that, unpatriotic
  as you may think it, the recognised
  function of the ‘Opposition’ is to hinder, in every
  manner not forbidden by the Law, the
  action of the Government. This process is
  called ‘Legitimate Obstruction’: and the greatest
  triumph the ‘Opposition’ can ever enjoy,
  is when they are able to point out that, owing
  to their ‘Obstruction’, the Government have
  failed in everything they have tried to do for
  the good of the Nation!</i>’”</p>
  </div></blockquote>
  <p>“Your friend has not put it <i>quite</i> correctly,”
  I said. “The Opposition would no doubt be
  glad to point out that the Government had
  failed <i>through their own fault</i>; but <i>not</i> that
  they had failed on account of <i>Obstruction</i>!”</p>
  <p>“You think so?” he gently replied. “Allow
  me now to read to you this newspaper-cutting,
  which my friend enclosed in his letter. It is
  part of the report of a public speech, made
  by a Statesman who was at the time a member
  of the ‘Opposition’:—</p>
  <blockquote><div>
  <p>“‘<i>At the close of the Session, he thought
  they had no reason to be discontented with the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_204">204</span>
  fortunes of the campaign. They had routed
  the enemy at every point. But the pursuit
  must be continued. They had only to follow
  up a disordered and dispirited foe.</i>’”</p>
  </div></blockquote>
  <p>“Now to what portion of your national
  history would you guess that the speaker
  was referring?”</p>
  <p>“Really, the number of <i>successful</i> wars we
  have waged during the last century,” I replied,
  with a glow of British pride, “is <i>far</i> too great
  for me to guess, with any chance of success,
  <i>which</i> it was we were then engaged in. However,
  I will name ‘<i>India</i>’ as the most probable.
  The Mutiny was no doubt, all but
  crushed, at the time that speech was made.
  What a fine, manly, <i>patriotic</i> speech it must
  have been!” I exclaimed in an outburst
  of enthusiasm.</p>
  <p>“You think so?” he replied, in a tone of
  gentle pity. “Yet my friend tells me that
  the ‘<i>disordered and dispirited foe</i>’ simply
  meant the Statesmen who happened to be in
  power at the moment; that the ‘<i>pursuit</i>’
  simply meant ‘Obstruction’; and that the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
  words ‘<i>they had routed the enemy</i>’ simply
  meant that the ‘Opposition’ had succeeded in
  hindering the Government from doing any of
  the work which the Nation had empowered
  them to do!”</p>
  <p>I thought it best to say nothing.</p>
  <p>“It seemed queer to <i>us</i>, just at first,” he
  resumed, after courteously waiting a minute
  for me to speak: “but, when once we had mastered
  the idea, our respect for your Nation
  was so great that we carried it into every
  department of life! It was ‘<i>the beginning of
  the end</i>’ with us. My country never held up
  its head again!” And the poor old gentleman
  sighed deeply.</p>
  <p>“Let us change the subject,” I said. “Do
  not distress yourself, I beg!”</p>
  <p>“No, no!” he said, with an effort to recover
  himself. “I had rather finish my story! The
  next step (after reducing our Government to
  impotence, and putting a stop to all useful
  legislation, which did not take us long to do)
  was to introduce what we called ‘the glorious
  British Principle of Dichotomy’ into <i>Agriculture</i>.
  We persuaded many of the well-to-do
  <span class="pb" id="Page_206">206</span>
  farmers to divide their staff of labourers into
  two Parties, and to set them one against the
  other. They were called, like our political
  Parties, the ‘Ins’ and the ‘Outs’: the business
  of the ‘Ins’ was to do as much of ploughing,
  sowing, or whatever might be needed, as they
  could manage in a day, and at night they were
  paid according to the amount they had <i>done</i>:
  the business of the ‘Outs’ was to hinder them,
  and <i>they</i> were paid for the amount they had
  <i>hindered</i>. The farmers found they had to pay
  only <i>half</i> as much wages as they did before,
  and they didn’t observe that the amount of
  work done was only a <i>quarter</i> as much as was
  done before: so they took it up quite enthusiastically,
  <i>at first</i>.”</p>
  <p>“And <i>afterwards</i>——?” I enquired.</p>
  <p>“Well, <i>afterwards</i> they didn’t like it quite
  so well. In a very short time, things settled
  down into a regular routine. No work <i>at all</i>
  was done. So the ‘Ins’ got no wages, and
  the ‘Outs’ got full pay. And the farmers
  never discovered, till most of them were
  ruined, that the rascals had agreed to manage
  it so, and had shared the pay between them!
  <span class="pb" id="Page_207">207</span>
  While the thing lasted, there were funny sights
  to be seen! Why, I’ve often watched a
  ploughman, with two horses harnessed to the
  plough, doing his best to get it <i>forwards</i>; while
  the opposition-ploughman, with three donkeys
  harnessed at the <i>other</i> end, was doing <i>his</i> best
  to get it <i>backwards</i>! And the plough never
  moving an inch, <i>either</i> way!”</p>
  <p>“But <i>we</i> never did anything like <i>that</i>!” I
  exclaimed.</p>
  <p>“Simply because you were less <i>logical</i> than
  we were,” replied Mein Herr. “There is
  <i>sometimes</i> an advantage in being a donk—Excuse
  me! No <i>personal</i> allusion intended.
  All this happened <i>long ago</i>, you know!”</p>
  <p>“Did the Dichotomy-Principle succeed in
  <i>any</i> direction?” I enquired.</p>
  <p>“In <i>none</i>,” Mein Herr candidly confessed.
  “It had a <i>very</i> short trial in <i>Commerce</i>. The
  shop-keepers <i>wouldn’t</i> take it up, after once
  trying the plan of having half the attendants
  busy in folding up and carrying away the
  goods which the other half were trying to
  spread out upon the counters. They said the
  Public didn’t like it!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_208">208</div>
  <p>“I don’t wonder at it,” I remarked.</p>
  <p>“Well, we tried ‘the British Principle’ for
  some years. And the end of it all was—”
  His voice suddenly dropped, almost to a
  whisper; and large tears began to roll down
  his cheeks. “—the end was that we got involved
  in a war; and there was a great battle,
  in which we far out-numbered the enemy.
  But what could one expect, when only <i>half</i> of
  our soldiers were fighting, and the other half
  pulling them back? It ended in a crushing
  defeat—an utter rout. This caused a Revolution;
  and most of the Government were
  banished. I myself was accused of Treason,
  for having so strongly advocated ‘the British
  Principle.’ My property was all forfeited,
  and—and—I was driven into exile! ‘Now
  the mischief’s done,’ they said, ‘perhaps you’ll
  kindly leave the country?’ It nearly broke
  my heart, but I had to go!”</p>
  <p>The melancholy tone became a wail: the
  wail became a chant: the chant became a
  song—though whether it was <i>Mein Herr</i> that
  was singing, this time, or somebody else, I
  could not feel certain.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“And, now the mischief’s done, perhaps</p>
  <p class="t0">You’ll kindly go and pack your traps?</p>
  <p class="t0">Since <span class="norm">two</span> (your daughter and your son)</p>
  <p class="t0">Are Company, but <span class="norm">three</span> are none.</p>
  <p class="t0">A course of saving we’ll begin:</p>
  <p class="t0">When change is needed, <span class="norm">I’ll</span> invent it:</p>
  <p class="t0">Don’t think to put <span class="norm">your</span> finger in</p>
  <p class="t0"><span class="norm">This</span> pie!” cried Tottles (and he meant it).</p>
  </div>
  <p>The music seemed to die away. Mein Herr
  was again speaking in his ordinary voice.
  “Now tell me one thing more,” he said. “Am
  I right in thinking that in <i>your</i> Universities,
  though a man may reside some thirty or forty
  years, you examine him, once for all, at the
  end of the first three or four?”</p>
  <p>“That is so, undoubtedly,” I admitted.</p>
  <p>“Practically, then, you examine a man at the
  <i>beginning</i> of his career!” the old man said
  to himself rather than to me. “And what
  guarantee have you that he <i>retains</i> the knowledge
  for which you have rewarded him—beforehand,
  as <i>we</i> should say?”</p>
  <p>“None,” I admitted, feeling a little puzzled
  at the drift of his remarks. “How do <i>you</i>
  secure that object?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
  <p>“By examining him at the <i>end</i> of his thirty
  or forty years—not at the beginning,” he
  gently replied. “On an average, the knowledge
  then found is about one-fifth of what
  it was at first—the process of forgetting
  going on at a very steady uniform rate—and
  he, who forgets <i>least</i>, gets <i>most</i> honour, and
  most rewards.”</p>
  <p>“Then you give him the money when he
  needs it no longer? And you make him live
  most of his life on <i>nothing</i>!”</p>
  <p>“Hardly that. He gives his orders to the
  tradesmen: they supply him, for forty, sometimes
  fifty, years, at their own risk: then he
  gets his Fellowship—which pays him in <i>one</i>
  year as much as <i>your</i> Fellowships pay in fifty—and
  then he can easily pay all his bills,
  with interest.”</p>
  <p>“But suppose he fails to get his Fellowship?
  That must occasionally happen.”</p>
  <p>“That occasionally happens.” It was Mein
  Herr’s turn, now, to make admissions.</p>
  <p>“And what becomes of the tradesmen?”</p>
  <p>“They calculate accordingly. When a man
  appears to be getting alarmingly ignorant, or
  <span class="pb" id="Page_211">211</span>
  stupid, they will sometimes refuse to supply
  him any longer. You have no idea with what
  enthusiasm a man will begin to rub up his
  forgotten sciences or languages, when his
  butcher has cut off the supply of beef and
  mutton!”</p>
  <p>“And who are the Examiners?”</p>
  <p>“The young men who have just come,
  brimming over with knowledge. You would
  think it a curious sight,” he went on, “to
  see mere boys examining such old men. I
  have known a man set to examine his own
  grandfather. It was a little painful for both
  of them, no doubt. The old gentleman was
  as bald as a coot——”</p>
  <p>“How bald would that be?” I’ve no idea
  why I asked this question. I felt I was getting
  foolish.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_212">212</div>
  <h2 id="c14">CHAPTER XIV.
  <br><span class="small">BRUNO’S PICNIC.</span></h2>
  <p>“As bald as bald,” was the bewildering
  reply. “Now, Bruno, I’ll tell you a story.”</p>
  <p>“And I’ll tell <i>oo</i> a story,” said Bruno, beginning
  in a great hurry for fear of Sylvie getting
  the start of him: “once there were a Mouse—a
  little tiny Mouse—such a tiny little Mouse!
  Oo never saw such a tiny Mouse——”</p>
  <p>“Did nothing ever happen to it, Bruno?” I
  asked. “Haven’t you anything more to tell
  us, besides its being so tiny?”</p>
  <p>“Nothing never happened to it,” Bruno
  solemnly replied.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
  <p>“Why did nothing never happen to it?” said
  Sylvie, who was sitting, with her head on
  Bruno’s shoulder, patiently waiting for a chance
  of beginning <i>her</i> story.</p>
  <p>“It were too tiny,” Bruno explained.</p>
  <p>“<i>That’s</i> no reason!” I said. “However
  tiny it was, things might happen to it.”</p>
  <p>Bruno looked pityingly at me, as if he thought
  me very stupid. “It were too tiny,” he repeated.
  “If anything happened to it, it would die—it
  were so <i>very</i> tiny!”</p>
  <p>“Really that’s enough about its being tiny!”
  Sylvie put in. “Haven’t you invented any more
  about it?”</p>
  <p>“Haven’t invented no more yet.”</p>
  <p>“Well then, you shouldn’t begin a story till
  you’ve invented more! Now be quiet, there’s
  a good boy, and listen to <i>my</i> story.”</p>
  <p>And Bruno, having quite exhausted all his
  inventive faculty, by beginning in too great
  a hurry, quietly resigned himself to listening.
  “Tell about the other Bruno, please,” he said
  coaxingly.</p>
  <p>Sylvie put her arms round his neck, and
  began:——</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
  <p>“The wind was whispering among the trees,”
  (“That wasn’t good manners!” Bruno interrupted.
  “Never mind about manners,” said
  Sylvie) “and it was evening—a nice moony
  evening, and the Owls were hooting——”</p>
  <p>“Pretend they weren’t Owls!” Bruno pleaded,
  stroking her cheek with his fat little hand. “I
  don’t like Owls. Owls have such great big eyes.
  Pretend they were Chickens!”</p>
  <p>“Are you afraid of their great big eyes,
  Bruno?” I said.</p>
  <p>“Aren’t <i>’fraid</i> of nothing,” Bruno answered in
  as careless a tone as he could manage: “they’re
  ugly with their great big eyes. I think if they
  cried, the tears would be as big—oh, as big as
  the moon!” And he laughed merrily. “Doos
  Owls cry ever, Mister Sir?”</p>
  <p>“Owls cry never,” I said gravely, trying to
  copy Bruno’s way of speaking: “they’ve got
  nothing to be sorry for, you know.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, but they have!” Bruno exclaimed.
  “They’re ever so sorry, ’cause they killed the
  poor little Mouses!”</p>
  <p>“But they’re not sorry when they’re <i>hungry</i>,
  I suppose?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
  <p>“Oo don’t know nothing about Owls!” Bruno
  scornfully remarked. “When they’re hungry,
  they’re very, <i>very</i> sorry they killed the little
  Mouses, ’cause if they <i>hadn’t</i> killed them there’d
  be sumfin for supper, oo know!”</p>
  <p>Bruno was evidently getting into a dangerously
  inventive state of mind, so Sylvie broke in
  with “Now I’m going on with the story. So
  the Owls—the Chickens, I mean—were looking
  to see if they could find a nice fat Mouse
  for their supper——”</p>
  <p>“Pretend it was a nice ’abbit!” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“But it <i>wasn’t</i> a nice habit, to kill Mouses,”
  Sylvie argued. “I can’t pretend <i>that</i>!”</p>
  <p>“I didn’t say ‘<i>habit</i>,’ oo silly fellow!” Bruno
  replied with a merry twinkle in his eye. “’<i>abbits</i>—that
  runs about in the fields!”</p>
  <p>“Rabbit? Well it can be a Rabbit, if you like.
  But you mustn’t alter my story so much, Bruno.
  A Chicken <i>couldn’t</i> eat a Rabbit!”</p>
  <p>“But it might have wished to see if it could
  try to eat it.”</p>
  <p>“Well, it wished to see if it could try—oh,
  really, Bruno, that’s nonsense! I shall go back
  to the Owls.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
  <p>“Well then, pretend they hadn’t great eyes!”</p>
  <p>“And they saw a little Boy,” Sylvie went
  on, disdaining to make any further corrections.
  “And he asked them to tell him a story. And
  the Owls hooted and flew away——” (“Oo
  shouldn’t say ‘<i>flewed</i>;’ oo should say ‘<i>flied</i>,’”
  Bruno whispered. But Sylvie wouldn’t hear.)
  “And he met a Lion. And he asked the Lion
  to tell him a story. And the Lion said ‘yes,’
  it would. And, while the Lion was telling him
  the story, it nibbled some of his head off——”</p>
  <p>“Don’t say ‘nibbled’!” Bruno entreated.
  “Only little things nibble—little thin sharp
  things, with edges——”</p>
  <p>“Well then, it ‘<i>nubbled</i>,’” said Sylvie. “And
  when it had nubbled <i>all</i> his head off, he went
  away, and he never said ‘thank you’!”</p>
  <p>“That were very rude,” said Bruno. “If he
  couldn’t speak, he might have nodded—no,
  he couldn’t nod. Well, he might have shaked
  <i>hands</i> with the Lion!”</p>
  <p>“Oh, I’d forgotten that part!” said Sylvie.
  “He <i>did</i> shake hands with it. He came back
  again, you know, and he thanked the Lion very
  much, for telling him the story.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_217">217</div>
  <p>“Then his head had growed up again?” said
  Bruno.</p>
  <p>“Oh yes, it grew up in a minute. And the
  Lion begged pardon, and said it wouldn’t nubble
  off little boys’ heads—not never no more!”</p>
  <p>Bruno looked much pleased at this change of
  events. “Now that are a <i>really</i> nice story!”
  he said. “<i>Aren’t</i> it a nice story, Mister Sir?”</p>
  <p>“Very,” I said. “I would like to hear another
  story about that Boy.”</p>
  <p>“So would <i>I</i>,” said Bruno, stroking Sylvie’s
  cheek again. “<i>Please</i> tell about Bruno’s Picnic;
  and don’t talk about <i>nubbly</i> Lions!”</p>
  <p>“I won’t, if it frightens you,” said Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“<i>Flightens</i> me!” Bruno exclaimed indignantly.
  “It isn’t <i>that</i>! It’s ’cause ‘nubbly’ ’s
  such a grumbly word to say—when one person’s
  got her head on another person’s shoulder.
  When she talks like that,” he explained
  to me, “the talking goes down bofe sides of
  my face—all the way to my chin—and it
  <i>doos</i> tickle so! It’s enough to make a beard
  grow, that it is!”</p>
  <p>He said this with great severity, but it was
  evidently meant for a joke: so Sylvie laughed—a
  <span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
  delicious musical little laugh, and laid her
  soft cheek on the top of her brother’s curly
  head, as if it were a pillow, while she went on
  with the story. “So this Boy——”</p>
  <p>“But it wasn’t <i>me</i>, oo know!” Bruno interrupted.
  “And oo needn’t try to look as if
  it was, Mister Sir!”</p>
  <p>I represented, respectfully, that I was trying
  to look as if it wasn’t.</p>
  <p>“—he was a middling good Boy——”</p>
  <p>“He were a <i>welly</i> good Boy!” Bruno corrected
  her. “And he never did nothing he
  wasn’t told to do——”</p>
  <p>“<i>That</i> doesn’t make a good Boy!” Sylvie
  said contemptuously.</p>
  <p>“That <i>do</i> make a good Boy!” Bruno insisted.</p>
  <p>Sylvie gave up the point. “Well, he was
  a <i>very</i> good Boy, and he always kept his promises,
  and he had a big cupboard——”</p>
  <p>“—for to keep all his promises in!” cried
  Bruno.</p>
  <p>“If he kept <i>all</i> his promises,” Sylvie said,
  with a mischievous look in her eyes, “he wasn’t
  like <i>some</i> Boys I know of!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
  <p>“He had to put <i>salt</i> with them, a-course,”
  Bruno said gravely: “oo ca’n’t keep promises
  when there isn’t any salt. And he kept his
  birthday on the second shelf.”</p>
  <p>“How long did he keep his birthday?” I
  asked. “I never can keep <i>mine</i> more than
  twenty-four hours.”</p>
  <p>“Why, a birthday <i>stays</i> that long by itself!”
  cried Bruno. “Oo doosn’t know how to keep
  birthdays! This Boy kept <i>his</i> a whole year!”</p>
  <p>“And then the next birthday would begin,”
  said Sylvie. “So it would be his birthday
  <i>always</i>.”</p>
  <p>“So it were,” said Bruno. “Doos <i>oo</i> have
  treats on <i>oor</i> birthday, Mister Sir?”</p>
  <p>“Sometimes,” I said.</p>
  <p>“When oo’re <i>good</i>, I suppose?”</p>
  <p>“Why, it <i>is</i> a sort of treat, being good, isn’t
  it?” I said.</p>
  <p>“A sort of <i>treat</i>!” Bruno repeated. “It’s
  a sort of <i>punishment</i>, <i>I</i> think!”</p>
  <p>“Oh, Bruno!” Sylvie interrupted, almost
  sadly. “How <i>can</i> you?”</p>
  <p>“Well, but it <i>is</i>,” Bruno persisted. “Why,
  look here, Mister Sir! <i>This</i> is being good!”
  <span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
  And he sat bolt upright, and put on an
  absurdly solemn face. “First oo must sit up
  as straight as pokers——”</p>
  <p>“—as <i>a</i> poker,” Sylvie corrected him.</p>
  <p>“—as straight as <i>pokers</i>,” Bruno firmly
  repeated. “Then oo must clasp oor hands—<i>so</i>.
  Then—‘Why hasn’t oo brushed oor
  hair? Go and brush it <i>toreckly</i>!’ Then—‘Oh,
  Bruno, oo mustn’t dog’s-ear the daisies!’
  Did oo learn <i>oor</i> spelling wiz daisies, Mister
  Sir?”</p>
  <p>“I want to hear about that Boy’s <i>Birthday</i>,”
  I said.</p>
  <p>Bruno returned to the story instantly.
  “Well, so this Boy said ‘Now it’s my Birthday!’
  And so—I’m tired!” he suddenly broke
  off, laying his head in Sylvie’s lap. “Sylvie
  knows it best. Sylvie’s grown-upper than me.
  Go on, Sylvie!”</p>
  <p>Sylvie patiently took up the thread of the
  story again. “So he said ‘Now it’s my
  Birthday. Whatever shall I do to keep my
  Birthday? All <i>good</i> little Boys——” (Sylvie
  turned away from Bruno, and made a great pretence
  of whispering to <i>me</i>) “—all <i>good</i> little
  <span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
  Boys—Boys that learn their lessons quite
  perfect—they always keep their birthdays,
  you know. So of course <i>this</i> little Boy kept
  <i>his</i> Birthday.”</p>
  <p>“Oo may call him Bruno, if oo like,” the
  little fellow carelessly remarked. “It weren’t
  <i>me</i>, but it makes it more interesting.”</p>
  <p>“So Bruno said to himself ‘The properest
  thing to do is to have a Picnic, all by myself,
  on the top of the hill. And I’ll take some
  Milk, and some Bread, and some Apples: and
  first and foremost, I want some <i>Milk</i>!’ So,
  first and foremost, Bruno took a milk-pail——”</p>
  <p>“And he went and milkted the Cow!”
  Bruno put in.</p>
  <p>“Yes,” said Sylvie, meekly accepting the
  new verb. “And the Cow said ‘Moo! What
  are you going to do with all that Milk?’ And
  Bruno said ‘Please’m, I want it for my Picnic.’
  And the Cow said ‘Moo! But I hope you
  wo’n’t <i>boil</i> any of it?’ And Bruno said ‘No,
  <i>indeed</i> I won’t! New Milk’s so nice and so
  warm, it wants no boiling!’”</p>
  <p>“It doesn’t want no boiling,” Bruno offered
  as an amended version.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_222">222</div>
  <p>“So Bruno put the Milk in a bottle. And
  then Bruno said ‘Now I want some Bread!’
  So he went to the Oven, and he took out a
  delicious new Loaf. And the Oven——”</p>
  <p>“—ever so light and so puffy!” Bruno
  impatiently corrected her. “Oo shouldn’t
  leave out so many words!”</p>
  <p>Sylvie humbly apologised. “—a delicious
  new Loaf, ever so light and so puffy. And
  the Oven said——” Here Sylvie made a long
  pause. “Really I don’t know <i>what</i> an Oven
  begins with, when it wants to speak!”</p>
  <p>Both children looked appealingly at me; but
  I could only say, helplessly, “I haven’t the
  least idea! <i>I</i> never heard an Oven speak!”</p>
  <p>For a minute or two we all sat silent; and
  then Bruno said, very softly, “Oven begins
  wiz ‘O’.”</p>
  <p>“<i>Good</i> little boy!” Sylvie exclaimed. “He
  does his spelling <i>very</i> nicely. <i>He’s cleverer
  than he knows!</i>” she added, aside, to <i>me</i>.
  “So the Oven said ‘O! What are you going
  to do with all that Bread?’ And Bruno said
  ‘Please——’ Is an Oven ‘Sir’ or ‘’m,’ would
  you say?” She looked to me for a reply.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_223">223</div>
  <p>“<i>Both</i>, I think,” seemed to me the safest
  thing to say.</p>
  <p>Sylvie adopted the suggestion instantly.
  “So Bruno said ‘Please, Sirm, I want it for
  my Picnic.’ And the Oven said ‘O! But I
  hope you wo’n’t <i>toast</i> any of it?’ And Bruno
  said ‘No, <i>indeed</i> I wo’n’t! New Bread’s so
  light and so puffy, it wants no toasting!’”</p>
  <p>“It never doesn’t want no toasting,” said
  Bruno. “I <i>wiss</i> oo wouldn’t say it so short!”</p>
  <p>“So Bruno put the Bread in the hamper.
  Then Bruno said ‘Now I want some Apples!’
  So he took the hamper, and he went to the
  Apple-Tree, and he picked some lovely ripe
  Apples. And the Apple-Tree said——” Here
  followed another long pause.</p>
  <p>Bruno adopted his favourite expedient of
  tapping his forehead; while Sylvie gazed
  earnestly upwards, as if she hoped for some
  suggestion from the birds, who were singing
  merrily among the branches overhead. But
  no result followed.</p>
  <p>“What <i>does</i> an Apple-tree begin with, when
  it wants to speak?” Sylvie murmured despairingly,
  to the irresponsive birds.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_224">224</div>
  <p>At last, taking a leaf out of Bruno’s book,
  I ventured on a remark. “Doesn’t ‘Apple-tree’
  always begin with ‘Eh!’?”</p>
  <p>“Why, of <i>course</i> it does! How <i>clever</i> of
  you!” Sylvie cried delightedly.</p>
  <p>Bruno jumped up, and patted me on the
  head. I tried not to feel conceited.</p>
  <p>“So the Apple Tree said ‘Eh! What are
  you going to do with all those Apples?’ And
  Bruno said ‘Please, Sir, I want them for
  my Picnic,’ And the Apple-Tree said ‘Eh!
  But I hope you wo’n’t <i>bake</i> any of them?’
  And Bruno said ‘No, <i>indeed</i> I wo’n’t! Ripe
  Apples are so nice and so sweet, they want
  no baking!’”</p>
  <p>“They never doesn’t——” Bruno was beginning,
  but Sylvie corrected herself before
  he could get the words out.</p>
  <p>“‘They never doesn’t nonow want no
  baking.’ So Bruno put the Apples in the
  hamper, along with the Bread, and the bottle
  of Milk. And he set off to have a Picnic,
  on the top of the hill, all by himself——”</p>
  <p>“He wasn’t greedy, oo know, to have it all
  by himself,” Bruno said, patting me on the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
  cheek to call my attention; “’cause he hadn’t
  got no brothers and sisters.”</p>
  <p>“It was very sad to have no <i>sisters</i>, wasn’t
  it?” I said.</p>
  <p>“Well, I don’t know,” Bruno said thoughtfully;
  “’cause he hadn’t no lessons to do. So
  he didn’t mind.”</p>
  <p>Sylvie went on. “So, as he was walking
  along the road, he heard behind him such a
  curious sort of noise—a sort of a Thump!
  Thump! Thump! ‘Whatever <i>is</i> that?’ said
  Bruno. ‘Oh, I know!’ said Bruno. ‘Why,
  it’s only my Watch a-ticking!’”</p>
  <p>“<i>Were</i> it his Watch a-ticking?” Bruno
  asked me, with eyes that fairly sparkled with
  mischievous delight.</p>
  <p>“No doubt of it!” I replied. And Bruno
  laughed exultingly.</p>
  <p>“Then Bruno thought a little harder. And
  he said ‘No! It <i>ca’n’t</i> be my Watch a-ticking;
  because I haven’t <i>got</i> a Watch!’”</p>
  <p>Bruno peered up anxiously into my face,
  to see how I took it. I hung my head, and
  put a thumb into my mouth, to the evident
  delight of the little fellow.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
  <p>“So Bruno went a little further along the
  road. And then he heard it again, that queer
  noise—Thump! Thump! Thump! ‘What
  ever <i>is</i> that?’ said Bruno. ‘Oh, I know!’
  said Bruno. ‘Why, it’s only the Carpenter
  a-mending my Wheelbarrow!’”</p>
  <p>“<i>Were</i> it the Carterpenter a-mending his
  Wheelbarrow?” Bruno asked me.</p>
  <p>I brightened up, and said “It <i>must</i> have
  been!” in a tone of absolute conviction.</p>
  <p>Bruno threw his arms round Sylvie’s neck.
  “Sylvie!” he said, in a perfectly audible
  whisper. “He says it <i>must</i> have been!”</p>
  <p>“Then Bruno thought a little harder. And
  he said ‘No! It <i>ca’n’t</i> be the Carpenter
  amending my Wheelbarrow, because I haven’t
  <i>got</i> a Wheelbarrow!’”</p>
  <p>This time I hid my face in my hands, quite
  unable to meet Bruno’s look of triumph.</p>
  <p>“So Bruno went a little further along the
  road. And then he heard that queer noise
  again—Thump! Thump! Thump! So he
  thought he’d look round, <i>this</i> time, just to <i>see</i>
  what it was. And what should it be but a
  great Lion!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_227">227</div>
  <p>“A great big Lion,” Bruno corrected her.</p>
  <p>“A great big Lion. And Bruno was ever
  so frightened, and he ran——”</p>
  <p>“No, he wasn’t <i>flightened</i> a bit!” Bruno
  interrupted. (He was evidently anxious for
  the reputation of his namesake.) “He runned
  away to get a good look at the Lion; ’cause
  he wanted to see if it were the same Lion
  what used to nubble little Boys’ heads off; and
  he wanted to know how big it was!”</p>
  <p>“Well, he ran away, to get a good look at
  the Lion. And the Lion trotted slowly after
  him. And the Lion called after him, in a very
  gentle voice, ‘Little Boy, little Boy! You
  needn’t be afraid of <i>me</i>! I’m a very <i>gentle</i>
  old Lion now. I <i>never</i> nubble little Boys’
  heads off, as I used to do.’ And so Bruno
  said ‘Don’t you <i>really</i>, Sir? Then what do
  you live on?’ And the Lion——”</p>
  <p>“Oo <i>see</i> he weren’t a bit flightened!”
  Bruno said to me, patting my cheek again.
  “’cause he remembered to call it ‘Sir,’ oo
  know.”</p>
  <p>I said that no doubt that was the <i>real</i> test
  whether a person was frightened or not.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
  <p>“And the Lion said ‘Oh, I live on bread-and-butter,
  and cherries, and marmalade, and
  plum-cake———’”</p>
  <p>“—and <i>apples</i>!” Bruno put in.</p>
  <p>“Yes, ‘and apples.’ And Bruno said ‘Won’t
  you come with me to my Picnic?’ And the
  Lion said ‘Oh, I should like it <i>very much indeed</i>!’
  And Bruno and the Lion went away
  together.” Sylvie stopped suddenly.</p>
  <p>“Is that <i>all</i>?” I asked, despondingly.</p>
  <p>“Not <i>quite</i> all,” Sylvie slily replied. “There’s
  a sentence or two more. Isn’t there, Bruno?”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” with a carelessness that was evidently
  put on: “just a sentence or two more.”</p>
  <p>“And, as they were walking along, they
  looked over a hedge, and who should they see
  but a little black Lamb! And the Lamb was
  ever so frightened. And it ran——”</p>
  <p>“It were <i>really</i> flightened!” Bruno put in.</p>
  <p>“It ran away. And Bruno ran after it. And
  he called ‘Little Lamb! You needn’t be afraid
  of <i>this</i> Lion! It <i>never</i> kills things! It lives
  on cherries, and marmalade——’”</p>
  <p>“—and <i>apples</i>!” said Bruno. “Oo
  <i>always</i> forgets the apples!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
  <p>“And Bruno said ‘Wo’n’t you come with
  us to my Picnic?’ And the Lamb said ‘Oh,
  I should like it <i>very much indeed</i>, if my Ma
  will let me!’ And Bruno said ‘Let’s go and
  ask your Ma!’ And they went to the old
  Sheep. And Bruno said ‘Please, may your
  little Lamb come to my Picnic?’ And the
  Sheep said ‘Yes, if it’s learnt all its lessons.’
  And the Lamb said ‘Oh yes, Ma! I’ve learnt
  <i>all</i> my lessons!’”</p>
  <p>“Pretend it hadn’t any lessons!” Bruno
  earnestly pleaded.</p>
  <p>“Oh, that would never do!” said Sylvie.
  “I ca’n’t leave out all about the lessons! And
  the old Sheep said ‘Do you know your A B C
  yet? Have you learnt A?’ And the Lamb
  said ‘Oh yes, Ma! I went to the A-field, and
  I helped them to make A!’ ‘Very good, my
  child! And have you learnt B?’ ‘Oh yes,
  Ma! I went to the B-hive, and the B gave me
  some honey!’ ‘Very good, my child! And
  have you learnt C?’ ‘Oh yes, Ma! I went
  to the C-side, and I saw the ships sailing on
  the C!’ ‘Very good, my child! You may go
  to Bruno’s Picnic.’</p>

  <p>“So they set off. And Bruno walked in the
  middle, so that the Lamb mightn’t see the
  Lion——”</p>
  <p>“It were <i>flightened</i>,” Bruno explained.</p>
  <p>“Yes, and it trembled so; and it got paler
  and paler; and, before they’d got to the top
  of the hill, it was a <i>white</i> little Lamb—as
  white as snow!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_231">231</div>
  <p>“But <i>Bruno</i> weren’t flightened!” said the
  owner of that name. “So <i>he</i> staid black!”</p>
  <p>“No, he <i>didn’t</i> stay black! He staid <i>pink</i>!”
  laughed Sylvie. “I shouldn’t kiss you like this,
  you know, if you were <i>black</i>!”</p>
  <p>“Oo’d <i>have</i> to!” Bruno said with great decision.
  “Besides, Bruno wasn’t <i>Bruno</i>, oo
  know—I mean, Bruno wasn’t <i>me</i>—I mean—don’t
  talk nonsense, Sylvie!”</p>
  <p>“I won’t do it again!” Sylvie said very
  humbly. “And so, as they went along, the
  Lion said ‘Oh, I’ll tell you what I used to do
  when I was a young Lion. I used to hide behind
  trees, to watch for little Boys.’” (Bruno
  cuddled a little closer to her.) “‘And, if a
  little thin scraggy Boy came by, why, I used
  to let him go. But, if a little fat juicy——’”</p>
  <p>Bruno could bear no more. “Pretend he
  wasn’t juicy!” he pleaded, half-sobbing.</p>
  <p>“Nonsense, Bruno!” Sylvie briskly replied.
  “It’ll be done in a moment! ‘—if a little
  fat juicy Boy came by, why, I used to spring
  out and gobble him up! Oh, you’ve no <i>idea</i>
  what a delicious thing it is—a little juicy
  Boy!’ And Bruno said ‘Oh, if you please,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
  Sir, <i>don’t</i> talk about eating little boys! It
  makes me so <i>shivery</i>!’”</p>
  <p>The real Bruno shivered, in sympathy with
  the hero.</p>
  <p>“And the Lion said ‘Oh, well, we won’t talk
  about it, then! I’ll tell you what happened on
  my wedding-day——’”</p>
  <p>“I like <i>this</i> part better,” said Bruno, patting
  my cheek to keep me awake.</p>
  <p>“‘There was, oh, such a lovely wedding-breakfast!
  At <i>one</i> end of the table there was
  a large plum-pudding. And at the other end
  there was a nice roasted <i>Lamb</i>! Oh, you’ve
  no <i>idea</i> what a delicious thing it is—a nice
  roasted Lamb!’ And the Lamb said ‘Oh,
  if you please, Sir, <i>don’t</i> talk about eating
  Lambs! It makes me so <i>shivery</i>!’ And the
  Lion said ‘Oh, well, we won’t talk about it,
  then!’”</p>

  <h2 id="c15">CHAPTER XV.
  <br><span class="small">THE LITTLE FOXES.</span></h2>
  <p>“So, when they got to the top of the hill,
  Bruno opened the hamper: and he took out
  the Bread, and the Apples, and the Milk:
  and they ate, and they drank. And when
  they’d finished the Milk, and eaten half the
  Bread and half the Apples, the Lamb said
  ‘Oh, my paws is so sticky! I want to wash
  my paws!’ And the Lion said ‘Well, go
  down the hill, and wash them in the brook,
  yonder. We’ll wait for you!’”</p>
  <p>“It never comed back!” Bruno solemnly
  whispered to me.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_234">234</div>
  <p>But Sylvie overheard him. “You’re not to
  whisper, Bruno! It spoils the story! And
  when the Lamb had been gone a long time,
  the Lion said to Bruno ‘Do go and see after
  that silly little Lamb! It must have lost its
  way.’ And Bruno went down the hill. And
  when he got to the brook, he saw the Lamb
  sitting on the bank: and who should be sitting
  by it but an old Fox!”</p>
  <p>“Don’t know who <i>should</i> be sitting by it,”
  Bruno said thoughtfully to himself. “A old
  Fox <i>were</i> sitting by it.”</p>
  <p>“And the old Fox were saying,” Sylvie went
  on, for once conceding the grammatical point,
  “‘Yes, my dear, you’ll be ever so happy with
  us, if you’ll only come and see us! I’ve got
  three little Foxes there, and we do love little
  Lambs so dearly!’ And the Lamb said ‘But
  you never <i>eat</i> them, do you, Sir?’ And the
  Fox said ‘Oh, no! What, <i>eat</i> a Lamb? We
  never <i>dream</i> of doing such a thing!’ So the
  Lamb said ‘Then I’ll come with you.’ And
  off they went, hand in hand.”</p>
  <p>“That Fox were welly extremely wicked,
  <i>weren’t</i> it?” said Bruno.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_235">235</div>
  <p>“No, no!” said Sylvie, rather shocked at
  such violent language. “It wasn’t quite so
  bad as that!”</p>
  <p>“Well, I mean, it wasn’t nice,” the little
  fellow corrected himself.</p>
  <p>“And so Bruno went back to the Lion.
  ‘Oh, come quick!’ he said. ‘The Fox has
  taken the Lamb to his house with him! I’m
  <i>sure</i> he means to eat it!’ And the Lion said
  ‘I’ll come as quick as ever I can!’ And they
  trotted down the hill.”</p>
  <p>“Do oo think he caught the Fox, Mister
  Sir?” said Bruno. I shook my head, not
  liking to speak: and Sylvie went on.</p>
  <p>“And when they got to the house, Bruno
  looked in at the window. And there he saw
  the three little Foxes sitting round the table,
  with their clean pinafores on, and spoons in
  their hands——”</p>
  <p>“Spoons in their hands!” Bruno repeated
  in an ecstasy of delight.</p>
  <p>“And the Fox had got a great big knife—all
  ready to kill the poor little Lamb——”
  (“Oo needn’t be flightened, Mister Sir!”
  Bruno put in, in a hasty whisper.)</p>

  <p>“And just as he was going to do it, Bruno
  heard a great ROAR——” (The real Bruno
  put his hand into mine, and held tight), “and
  the Lion came <i>bang</i> through the door, and
  the next moment it had bitten off the old
  Fox’s head! And Bruno jumped in at the
  window, and went leaping round the room, and
  crying out ‘Hooray! Hooray! The old Fox
  is dead! The old Fox is dead!’”</p>
  <p>Bruno got up in some excitement. “May I
  do it now?” he enquired.</p>
  <p>Sylvie was quite decided on this point.
  “Wait till afterwards,” she said. “The speeches
  come next, don’t you know? You always love
  the speeches, <i>don’t</i> you?”</p>
  <p>“Yes, I doos,” said Bruno: and sat down
  again.</p>
  <p>“The Lion’s speech. ‘Now, you silly little
  Lamb, go home to your mother, and never
  listen to old Foxes again. And be very good
  and obedient.’</p>
  <p>“The Lamb’s speech. ‘Oh, indeed, Sir, I
  will, Sir!’ and the Lamb went away.” (“But
  <i>oo</i> needn’t go away!” Bruno explained. “It’s
  quite the nicest part—what’s coming now!”
  <span class="pb" id="Page_238">238</span>
  Sylvie smiled. She liked having an appreciative
  audience.)</p>
  <p>“The Lion’s speech to Bruno. ‘Now,
  Bruno, take those little Foxes home with
  you, and teach them to be good obedient
  little Foxes! Not like that wicked old thing
  there, that’s got no head!’” (“That hasn’t
  got no head,” Bruno repeated.)</p>
  <p>“Bruno’s speech to the Lion. ‘Oh, indeed,
  Sir, I will, Sir!’ And the Lion went away.”
  (“It gets betterer and betterer, now,” Bruno
  whispered to me, “right away to the end!”)</p>
  <p>“Bruno’s speech to the little Foxes. ‘Now,
  little Foxes, you’re going to have your first
  lesson in being good. I’m going to put you
  into the hamper, along with the Apples and the
  Bread: and you’re not to eat the Apples: and
  you’re not to eat the Bread: and you’re not to
  eat <i>anything</i>——till we get to my house: and
  then you’ll have your supper.’</p>
  <p>“The little Foxes’ speech to Bruno. The
  little Foxes said nothing.</p>
  <p>“So Bruno put the Apples into the hamper—and
  the little Foxes—and the Bread——”
  (“They had picnicked all the Milk,” Bruno
  <span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
  explained in a whisper) “—and he set off
  to go to his house.” (“We’re getting near
  the end now,” said Bruno.)</p>
  <p>“And, when he had got a little way, he
  thought he would look into the hamper, and
  see how the little Foxes were getting on.”</p>
  <p>“So he opened the door——” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“Oh, Bruno!” Sylvie exclaimed, “<i>you’re</i>
  not telling the story! So he opened the door,
  and behold, there were no Apples! So Bruno
  said ‘Eldest little Fox, have <i>you</i> been eating
  the Apples?’ And the eldest little Fox said
  ‘No no no!’” (It is impossible to give the
  tone in which Sylvie repeated this rapid little
  ‘No no no!’ The nearest I can come to it
  is to say that it was much as if a young and
  excited duck had tried to quack the words.
  It was too quick for a quack, and yet too harsh
  to be anything else.) “Then he said ‘Second
  little Fox, have <i>you</i> been eating the Apples?’
  And the second little Fox said ‘No no no!’
  Then he said ‘Youngest little Fox, have <i>you</i>
  been eating the Apples?’ And the youngest
  little Fox <i>tried</i> to say ‘No no no!’ but its
  mouth was so full, it couldn’t, and it only
  <span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
  said ‘Wauch! Wauch! Wauch!’ And Bruno
  looked into its mouth. And its mouth was
  full of Apples! And Bruno shook his head,
  and he said ‘Oh dear, oh dear! What bad
  creatures these Foxes are!’”</p>
  <p>Bruno was listening intently: and, when
  Sylvie paused to take breath, he could only
  just gasp out the words “About the Bread?”</p>
  <p>“Yes,” said Sylvie, “the Bread comes next.
  So he shut the door again; and he went a
  little further; and then he thought he’d just
  peep in once more. And behold, there was no
  Bread!” (“What do ‘behold’ <i>mean</i>?” said
  Bruno. “Hush!” said Sylvie.) “And he said
  ‘Eldest little Fox, have <i>you</i> been eating the
  Bread?’ And the eldest little Fox said ‘No
  no no!’ ‘Second little Fox, have <i>you</i> been
  eating the Bread?’ And the second little Fox
  only said ‘Wauch! Wauch! Wauch!’ And
  Bruno looked into its mouth, and its mouth
  was full of Bread!” (“It might have chokeded
  it,” said Bruno.) “So he said ‘Oh dear, oh
  dear! What <i>shall</i> I do with these Foxes?’
  And he went a little further.” (“Now comes
  the most interesting part,” Bruno whispered.)</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_241">241</div>
  <p>“And when Bruno opened the hamper again,
  what do you think he saw?” (“Only <i>two</i>
  Foxes!” Bruno cried in a great hurry.) “You
  shouldn’t tell it so quick. However, he <i>did</i>
  see only <i>two</i> Foxes. And he said ‘Eldest
  little Fox, have you been eating the youngest
  little Fox?’ And the eldest little Fox said
  ‘No no no!’ ‘Second little Fox, have <i>you</i>
  been eating the youngest little Fox?’ And
  the second little Fox did its very best to say
  ‘No no no!’ but it could only say ‘Weuchk!
  Weuchk! Weuchk!’ And when Bruno looked
  into its mouth, it was half full of Bread, and
  half full of Fox!” (Bruno said nothing in the
  pause this time. He was beginning to pant a
  little, as he knew the crisis was coming.)</p>
  <p>“And when he’d got nearly home, he looked
  once more into the hamper, and he saw——”</p>
  <p>“Only——” Bruno began, but a generous
  thought struck him, and he looked at me. “<i>Oo</i>
  may say it, <i>this</i> time, Mister Sir!” he whispered.
  It was a noble offer, but I wouldn’t
  rob him of the treat. “Go on, Bruno,” I said,
  “you say it much the best.” “Only—but—<i>one</i>—Fox!”
  Bruno said with great solemnity.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_242">242</div>
  <div class="img" id="fig19">
  <img alt="‘WHIHUAUCH! WHIHUAUCH!’" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i242.jpg" id="id-3467373719617727664" width="500" height="745">
  <p class="center small">‘WHIHUAUCH! WHIHUAUCH!’</p>
  </div>
  <p>“‘Eldest little Fox,’” Sylvie said, dropping
  the narrative-form in her eagerness, “‘you’ve
  been <i>so</i> good that I can hardly believe <i>you’ve</i>
  been disobedient: but I’m <i>afraid</i> you’ve been
  eating your little sister?’ And the eldest little
  Fox said ‘Whihuauch! Whihuauch!’ and then
  it choked. And Bruno looked into its mouth,
  and it <i>was</i> full!” (Sylvie paused to take
  breath, and Bruno lay back among the daisies,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_243">243</span>
  and looked at me triumphantly. “Isn’t it
  <i>grand</i>, Mister Sir?” said he. I tried hard to
  assume a critical tone. “It’s grand,” I said:
  “but it frightens one so!” “Oo may sit a
  little closer to <i>me</i>, if oo like,” said Bruno.)</p>
  <p>“And so Bruno went home: and took the
  hamper into the kitchen, and opened it. And
  he saw——” Sylvie looked at <i>me</i>, this time, as
  if she thought I had been rather neglected and
  ought to be allowed <i>one</i> guess, at any rate.</p>
  <p>“He ca’n’t guess!” Bruno cried eagerly.
  “I ’fraid I <i>must</i> tell him! There weren’t—<i>nuffin</i>
  in the hamper!” I shivered in terror,
  and Bruno clapped his hands with delight.
  “He <i>is</i> flightened, Sylvie! Tell the rest!”</p>
  <p>“So Bruno said ‘Eldest little Fox, have you
  been eating <i>yourself</i>, you wicked little Fox?’
  And the eldest little Fox said ‘Whihuauch!’
  And then Bruno saw there was only its <i>mouth</i>
  in the hamper! So he took the mouth, and he
  opened it, and shook, and shook! And at last
  he shook the little Fox out of its own mouth!
  And then he said ‘Open your mouth again,
  you wicked little thing!’ And he shook, and
  shook! And he shook out the second little
  <span class="pb" id="Page_244">244</span>
  Fox! And he said ‘Now open <i>your</i> mouth!’
  And he shook, and shook! And he shook out
  the youngest little Fox, and all the Apples, and
  all the Bread!</p>
  <p>“And then Bruno stood the little Foxes up
  against the wall: and he made them a little
  speech. ‘Now, little Foxes, you’ve begun very
  wickedly—and you’ll have to be punished.
  First you’ll go up to the nursery, and wash
  your faces, and put on clean pinafores. Then
  you’ll hear the bell ring for supper. Then you’ll
  come down: and <i>you won’t have any supper</i>:
  but you’ll have a good <i>whipping</i>! Then you’ll
  go to bed. Then in the morning you’ll hear
  the bell ring for breakfast. <i>But you won’t have
  any breakfast!</i> You’ll have a good <i>whipping</i>!
  Then you’ll have your lessons. And, perhaps,
  if you’re <i>very</i> good, when dinner-time comes,
  you’ll have a little dinner, and no more
  whipping!’” (“How <i>very</i> kind he was!” I
  whispered to Bruno. “<i>Middling</i> kind,” Bruno
  corrected me gravely.)</p>
  <p>“So the little Foxes ran up to the nursery.
  And soon Bruno went into the hall, and rang
  the big bell. ‘Tingle, tingle, tingle! Supper,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
  supper, supper!’ Down came the little Foxes,
  in such a hurry for their supper! Clean pinafores!
  Spoons in their hands! And, when they
  got into the dining-room, there was ever such
  a white table-cloth on the table! But there was
  nothing on it but a big whip. And they had
  <i>such</i> a whipping!” (I put my handkerchief to
  my eyes, and Bruno hastily climbed upon my
  knee and stroked my face. “Only <i>one</i> more
  whipping, Mister Sir!” he whispered. “Don’t
  cry more than oo ca’n’t help!”)</p>
  <p>“And the next morning early, Bruno rang
  the big bell again. ‘Tingle, tingle, tingle!
  Breakfast, breakfast, breakfast!’ Down came
  the little Foxes! Clean pinafores! Spoons in
  their hands! No breakfast! Only the big
  whip! Then came lessons,” Sylvie hurried on,
  for I still had my handkerchief to my eyes.
  “And the little Foxes were ever so good!
  And they learned their lessons backwards,
  and forwards, and upside-down. And at last
  Bruno rang the big bell again. ‘Tingle, tingle,
  tingle! Dinner, dinner, dinner!’ And when
  the little Foxes came down——” (“Had they
  clean pinafores on?” Bruno enquired. “Of
  <span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
  course!” said Sylvie. “And spoons?” “Why,
  you <i>know</i> they had!” “Couldn’t be <i>certain</i>,”
  said Bruno.) “—they came as slow as slow!
  And they said ‘Oh! There’ll be no dinner!
  There’ll only be the big whip!’ But, when
  they got into the room, they saw the most
  <i>lovely</i> dinner!” (“Buns?” cried Bruno, clapping
  his hands.) “Buns, and cake, and——”
  (“—and jam?” said Bruno.) “Yes, jam—and
  soup—and——” (“—and <i>sugar plums</i>!”
  Bruno put in once more; and Sylvie seemed
  satisfied.)</p>
  <p>“And ever after that, they <i>were</i> such good
  little Foxes! They did their lessons as good
  as gold—and they never did what Bruno told
  them not to—and they never ate each other
  any more—and <i>they never ate themselves</i>!”</p>
  <p>The story came to an end so suddenly,
  it almost took my breath away; however I did
  my best to make a pretty speech of thanks.
  “I’m sure it’s very—very—very much so,
  I’m sure!” I seemed to hear myself say.</p>

  <h2 id="c16">CHAPTER XVI.
  <br><span class="small">BEYOND THESE VOICES.</span></h2>
  <p>“I didn’t quite catch what you said!” were
  the next words that reached my ear, but certainly
  <i>not</i> in the voice either of Sylvie or of
  Bruno, whom I could just see, through the
  crowd of guests, standing by the piano, and
  listening to the Count’s song. Mein Herr was
  the speaker. “I didn’t quite catch what you
  said!” he repeated. “But I’ve no doubt you
  take <i>my</i> view of it. Thank you <i>very</i> much for
  your kind attention. There is only but <i>one</i>
  verse left to be sung!” These last words were
  not in the gentle voice of Mein Herr, but in
  <span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
  the deep bass of the French Count. And, in
  the silence that followed, the final stanza of
  ‘Tottles’ rang through the room.</p>
  <div class="img" id="fig20">
  <img alt="‘NEVER!’ YELLED TOTTLES" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i248.jpg" id="id-1673808536764448991" width="500" height="382">
  <p class="center small">‘NEVER!’ YELLED TOTTLES</p>
  </div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">See now this couple settled down</p>
  <p class="t0">In quiet lodgings, out of town:</p>
  <p class="t0">Submissively the tearful wife</p>
  <p class="t0">Accepts a plain and humble life:</p>
  <p class="t0">Yet begs one boon on bended knee:</p>
  <p class="t0">‘My ducky-darling, don’t resent it!</p>
  <p class="t0">Mamma might come for two or three——’</p>
  <p class="t0">‘NEVER!’ yelled Tottles. And he meant it.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
  <p>The conclusion of the song was followed by
  quite a chorus of thanks and compliments from
  all parts of the room, which the gratified singer
  responded to by bowing low in all directions.
  “It is to me a great privilege,” he said to Lady
  Muriel, “to have met with this so marvellous a
  song. The accompaniment to him is so strange,
  so mysterious: it is as if a new music were to
  be invented! I will play him once again so as
  that to show you what I mean.” He returned
  to the piano, but the song had vanished.</p>
  <p>The bewildered singer searched through the
  heap of music lying on an adjoining table, but
  it was not there, either. Lady Muriel helped
  in the search: others soon joined: the excitement
  grew. “What <i>can</i> have become of it?”
  exclaimed Lady Muriel. Nobody knew: one
  thing only was certain, that no one had been
  near the piano since the Count had sung the
  last verse of the song.</p>
  <p>“Nevare mind him!” he said, most good-naturedly.
  “I shall give it you with memory
  alone!” He sat down, and began vaguely fingering
  the notes; but nothing resembling the
  tune came out. Then he, too, grew excited.
  <span class="pb" id="Page_250">250</span>
  “But what oddness! How much of singularity!
  That I might lose, not the words alone, but the
  tune also—that is quite curious, I suppose?”</p>
  <p>We all supposed it, heartily.</p>
  <p>“It was that sweet little boy, who found it
  for me,” the Count suggested. “Quite perhaps
  <i>he</i> is the thief?”</p>
  <p>“Of course he is!” cried Lady Muriel.
  “Bruno! Where are you, my darling?”</p>
  <p>But no Bruno replied: it seemed that the
  two children had vanished as suddenly, and as
  mysteriously, as the song.</p>
  <p>“They are playing us a trick!” Lady Muriel
  gaily exclaimed. “This is only an <i>ex tempore</i>
  game of Hide-and-Seek! That little Bruno is
  an embodied Mischief!”</p>
  <p>The suggestion was a welcome one to most
  of us, for some of the guests were beginning
  to look decidedly uneasy. A general search was
  set on foot with much enthusiasm: curtains were
  thrown back and shaken, cupboards opened, and
  ottomans turned over; but the number of possible
  hiding-places proved to be strictly limited;
  and the search came to an end almost as soon
  as it had begun.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
  <p>“They must have run out, while we were
  wrapped up in the song,” Lady Muriel said,
  addressing herself to the Count, who seemed
  more agitated than the others; “and no doubt
  they’ve found their way back to the housekeeper’s
  room.”</p>
  <p>“Not by <i>this</i> door!” was the earnest protest
  of a knot of two or three gentlemen, who had
  been grouped round the door (one of them
  actually leaning against it) for the last half-hour,
  as they declared. “<i>This</i> door has not
  been opened since the song began!”</p>
  <p>An uncomfortable silence followed this announcement.
  Lady Muriel ventured no further
  conjectures, but quietly examined the fastenings
  of the windows, which opened as doors. They
  all proved to be well fastened, <i>inside</i>.</p>
  <p>Not yet at the end of her resources, Lady
  Muriel rang the bell. “Ask the housekeeper
  to step here,” she said, “and to bring the
  children’s walking-things with her.”</p>
  <p>“I’ve brought them, my Lady,” said the
  obsequious housekeeper, entering after another
  minute of silence. “I thought the young
  lady would have come to my room to put on
  <span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
  her boots. Here’s your boots, my love!” she
  added cheerfully, looking in all directions for
  the children. There was no answer, and she
  turned to Lady Muriel with a puzzled smile.
  “Have the little darlings hid themselves?”</p>
  <p>“I don’t see them, just now,” Lady Muriel
  replied, rather evasively. “You can leave their
  things here, Wilson. <i>I’ll</i> dress them, when
  they’re ready to go.”</p>
  <p>The two little hats, and Sylvie’s walking-jacket,
  were handed round among the ladies,
  with many exclamations of delight. There
  certainly was a sort of witchery of beauty about
  them. Even the little boots did not miss their
  share of favorable criticism. “Such natty little
  things!” the musical young lady exclaimed,
  almost fondling them as she spoke. “And
  what tiny tiny feet they must have!”</p>
  <p>Finally, the things were piled together on the
  centre-ottoman, and the guests, despairing of
  seeing the children again, began to wish good-night
  and leave the house.</p>
  <p>There were only some eight or nine left—to
  whom the Count was explaining, for the
  twentieth time, how he had had his eye on the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
  children during the last verse of the song; how
  he had then glanced round the room, to see
  what effect “de great chest-note” had had
  upon his audience; and how, when he looked
  back again, they had both disappeared—when
  exclamations of dismay began to be heard
  on all sides, the Count hastily bringing his
  story to an end to join in the outcry.</p>
  <p>The walking-things had all disappeared!</p>
  <p>After the utter failure of the search for the
  <i>children</i>, there was a very half-hearted search
  made for their <i>apparel</i>. The remaining guests
  seemed only too glad to get away, leaving only
  the Count and our four selves.</p>
  <p>The Count sank into an easy-chair, and
  panted a little.</p>
  <p>“Who then <i>are</i> these dear children, I pray
  you?” he said. “Why come they, why go
  they, in this so little ordinary a fashion? That
  the music should make itself to vanish—that
  the hats, the boots, should make themselves to
  vanish—how is it, I pray you?”</p>
  <p>“I’ve no idea where they are!” was all I
  could say, on finding myself appealed to, by
  general consent, for an explanation.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_254">254</div>
  <p>The Count seemed about to ask further
  questions, but checked himself.</p>
  <p>“The hour makes himself to become late,”
  he said. “I wish to you a very good night,
  my Lady. I betake myself to my bed—to
  dream—if that indeed I be not dreaming
  now!” And he hastily left the room.</p>
  <p>“Stay awhile, stay awhile!” said the Earl,
  as I was about to follow the Count. “<i>You</i>
  are not a guest, you know! Arthur’s friend
  is at <i>home</i> here!”</p>
  <p>“Thanks!” I said, as, with true English
  instincts, we drew our chairs together round
  the fire-place, though no fire was burning—Lady
  Muriel having taken the heap of music
  on her knee, to have one more search for the
  strangely-vanished song.</p>
  <p>“Don’t you sometimes feel a wild longing,”
  she said, addressing herself to me, “to have
  something more to do with your hands, while
  you talk, than just holding a cigar, and now
  and then knocking off the ash? Oh, I know
  all that you’re going to say!” (This was to
  Arthur, who appeared about to interrupt her.)
  “The Majesty of Thought supersedes the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
  work of the fingers. A Man’s severe thinking,
  <i>plus</i> the shaking-off a cigar-ash, comes to the
  same total as a Woman’s trivial fancies, <i>plus</i>
  the most elaborate embroidery. <i>That’s</i> your
  sentiment, isn’t it, only better expressed?”</p>
  <p>Arthur looked into the radiant, mischievous
  face, with a grave and very tender smile.
  “Yes,” he said resignedly: “that is my sentiment,
  exactly.”</p>
  <p>“Rest of body, and activity of mind,” I put
  in. “Some writer tells us <i>that</i> is the acme of
  human happiness.”</p>
  <p>“Plenty of <i>bodily</i> rest, at any rate!” Lady
  Muriel replied, glancing at the three recumbent
  figures around her. “But what you call
  activity of <i>mind</i>——”</p>
  <p>“—is the privilege of young Physicians
  <i>only</i>,” said the Earl. “We old men have no
  claim to be active! <i>What can an old man
  do but die?</i>”</p>
  <p>“A good many other things, I should <i>hope</i>,”
  Arthur said earnestly.</p>
  <p>“Well, maybe. Still you have the advantage
  of me in many ways, dear boy! Not
  only that <i>your</i> day is dawning while <i>mine</i> is
  <span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
  setting, but your <i>interest</i> in Life—somehow I
  ca’n’t help envying you <i>that</i>. It will be many
  a year before you lose your hold of <i>that</i>.”</p>
  <p>“Yet surely many human interests <i>survive</i>
  human Life?” I said.</p>
  <p>“Many do, no doubt. And <i>some</i> forms of
  Science; but only <i>some</i>, I think. Mathematics,
  for instance: <i>that</i> seems to possess an endless
  interest: one ca’n’t imagine <i>any</i> form of Life,
  or <i>any</i> race of intelligent beings, where Mathematical
  truth would lose its meaning. But I
  fear <i>Medicine</i> stands on a different footing.
  Suppose you discover a remedy for some disease
  hitherto supposed to be incurable. Well,
  it is delightful for the moment, no doubt—full
  of interest—perhaps it brings you fame and
  fortune. But what then? Look on, a few
  years, into a life where disease has no existence.
  What is your discovery worth, <i>then</i>?
  Milton makes Jove promise too much. ‘<i>Of
  so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.</i>’ Poor
  comfort, when one’s ‘fame’ concerns matters
  that will have ceased to have a meaning!”</p>
  <p>“At any rate, one wouldn’t care to make
  any <i>fresh</i> medical discoveries,” said Arthur.
  <span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
  “I see no help for <i>that</i>—though I shall be
  sorry to give up my favorite studies. Still,
  medicine, disease, pain, sorrow, sin—I fear
  they’re all linked together. Banish sin, and
  you banish them all!”</p>
  <p>“<i>Military</i> science is a yet stronger instance,”
  said the Earl. “Without sin, <i>war</i> would surely
  be impossible. Still any mind, that has had in
  this life any keen interest, not in <i>itself</i> sinful,
  will surely find itself <i>some</i> congenial line of
  work hereafter. Wellington may have no more
  <i>battles</i> to fight—and yet—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">‘We doubt not that, for one so true,</p>
  <p class="t0">There must be other, nobler work to do,</p>
  <p class="t0">Than when he fought at Waterloo,</p>
  <p class="t3">And Victor he must ever be!’”</p>
  </div>
  <p>He lingered over the beautiful words, as if
  he loved them: and his voice, like distant
  music, died away into silence.</p>
  <p>After a minute or two he began again. “If
  I’m not wearying you, I would like to tell you
  an idea of the future Life which has haunted
  me for years, like a sort of waking nightmare—I
  ca’n’t reason myself out of it.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_258">258</div>
  <p>“Pray do,” Arthur and I replied, almost in
  a breath. Lady Muriel put aside the heap
  of music, and folded her hands together.</p>
  <p>“The one idea,” the Earl resumed, “that
  has seemed to me to overshadow all the rest,
  is that of <i>Eternity</i>—involving, as it seems to
  do, the necessary <i>exhaustion</i> of all subjects of
  human interest. Take Pure Mathematics, for
  instance—a Science independent of our present
  surroundings. I have studied it, myself,
  a little. Take the subject of circles and ellipses—what
  we call ‘curves of the second degree.’
  In a future Life, it would only be a
  question of so many years (or <i>hundreds</i> of
  years, if you like), for a man to work out <i>all</i>
  their properties. Then he <i>might</i> go to curves
  of the third degree. Say <i>that</i> took ten times
  as long (you see we have <i>unlimited</i> time to
  deal with). I can hardly imagine his <i>interest</i>
  in the subject holding out even for those; and,
  though there is no limit to the <i>degree</i> of the
  curves he might study, yet surely the time,
  needed to exhaust <i>all</i> the novelty and interest
  of the subject, would be absolutely <i>finite</i>?
  And so of all other branches of Science. And,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
  when I transport myself, in thought, through
  some thousands or millions of years, and fancy
  myself possessed of as much Science as one
  created reason can carry, I ask myself ‘What
  then? With nothing more to learn, can one
  rest content on <i>knowledge</i>, for the eternity yet
  to be lived through?’ It has been a very
  wearying thought to me. I have sometimes
  fancied one <i>might</i>, in that event, say ‘It is
  better <i>not</i> to be,’ and pray for personal <i>annihilation</i>—the
  Nirvana of the Buddhists.”</p>
  <p>“But that is only half the picture,” I said.
  “Besides working for <i>oneself</i>, may there not
  be the helping of <i>others</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Surely, surely!” Lady Muriel exclaimed
  in a tone of relief, looking at her father with
  sparkling eyes.</p>
  <p>“Yes,” said the Earl, “so long as there <i>were</i>
  any others needing help. But, given ages and
  ages more, surely all created reasons would at
  length reach the same dead level of <i>satiety</i>.
  And <i>then</i> what is there to look forward to?”</p>
  <p>“I know that weary feeling,” said the young
  Doctor. “I have gone through it all, more
  than once. Now let me tell you how I have
  <span class="pb" id="Page_260">260</span>
  put it to myself. I have imagined a little child,
  playing with toys on his nursery-floor, and yet
  able to <i>reason</i>, and to look on, thirty years
  ahead. Might he not say to himself ‘By that
  time I shall have had enough of bricks and
  ninepins. How weary Life will be!’ Yet, if
  we look forward through those thirty years, we
  find him a great statesman, full of interests and
  joys far more intense than his baby-life could
  give—joys wholly inconceivable to his baby-mind—joys
  such as no baby-language could in
  the faintest degree describe. Now, may not our
  life, a million years hence, have the same relation,
  to our life now, that the man’s life has to
  the child’s? And, just as one might try, all in
  vain, to express to that child, in the language
  of bricks and ninepins, the meaning of ‘politics,’
  so perhaps all those descriptions of Heaven,
  with its music, and its feasts, and its streets of
  gold, may be only attempts to describe, in <i>our</i>
  words, things for which we <i>really</i> have no
  words at all. Don’t you think that, in <i>your</i>
  picture of another life, you are in fact transplanting
  that child into political life, without
  making any allowance for his growing up?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_261">261</div>
  <p>“I think I understand you,” said the Earl.
  “The music of Heaven <i>may</i> be something
  beyond our powers of thought. Yet the music
  of Earth is sweet! Muriel, my child, sing us
  something before we go to bed!”</p>
  <p>“Do,” said Arthur, as he rose and lit the
  candles on the cottage-piano, lately banished
  from the drawing-room to make room for a
  ‘semi-grand.’ “There is a song here, that I
  have never heard you sing.</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">‘Hail to thee, blithe spirit!</p>
  <p class="t">Bird thou never wert,</p>
  <p class="t0">That from Heaven, or near it,</p>
  <p class="t">Pourest thy full heart!’”</p>
  </div>
  <p>he read from the page he had spread open
  before her.</p>
  <p>“And our little life here,” the Earl went on,
  “is, to that grand time, like a child’s summer-day!
  One gets tired as night draws on,” he
  added, with a touch of sadness in his voice,
  “and one gets to long for bed! For those
  welcome words ‘Come, child, ’tis bed-time!’”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_262">262</div>
  <h2 id="c17">CHAPTER XVII.
  <br><span class="small">TO THE RESCUE!</span></h2>
  <p>“It <i>isn’t</i> bed-time!” said a sleepy little
  voice. “The owls hasn’t gone to bed, and I
  s’a’n’t go to seep wizout oo sings to me!”</p>
  <p>“Oh, Bruno!” cried Sylvie. “Don’t you
  know the owls have only just got up? But
  the <i>frogs</i> have gone to bed, ages ago.”</p>
  <p>“Well, <i>I</i> aren’t a frog,” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“What shall I sing?” said Sylvie, skilfully
  avoiding the argument.</p>
  <p>“Ask Mister Sir,” Bruno lazily replied, clasping
  his hands behind his curly head, and lying
  back on his fern-leaf, till it almost bent over
  <span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
  with his weight. “This aren’t a comfable leaf,
  Sylvie. Find me a comfabler—please!” he
  added, as an after-thought, in obedience to a
  warning finger held up by Sylvie. “I doosn’t
  like being feet-upwards!”</p>
  <p>It was a pretty sight to see—the motherly
  way in which the fairy-child gathered up her
  little brother in her arms, and laid him on a
  stronger leaf. She gave it just a touch to set
  it rocking, and it went on vigorously by itself,
  as if it contained some hidden machinery. It
  certainly wasn’t the wind, for the evening-breeze
  had quite died away again, and not a leaf was
  stirring over our heads.</p>
  <p>“Why does that one leaf rock so, without
  the others?” I asked Sylvie. She only smiled
  sweetly and shook her head. “I don’t know
  <i>why</i>,” she said. “It always does, if it’s got a
  fairy-child on it. It <i>has</i> to, you know.”</p>
  <p>“And can people see the leaf rock, who ca’n’t
  see the Fairy on it?”</p>
  <p>“Why, of course!” cried Sylvie. “A leaf’s
  a leaf, and everybody can see it; but Bruno’s
  Bruno, and they ca’n’t see <i>him</i>, unless they’re
  eerie, like you.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_264">264</div>
  <p>Then I understood how it was that one
  sometimes sees—going through the woods in
  a still evening—one fern-leaf rocking steadily
  on, all by itself. Haven’t you ever seen that?
  Try if you can see the fairy-sleeper on it, next
  time; but don’t <i>pick</i> the leaf, whatever you do;
  let the little one sleep on!</p>
  <p>But all this time Bruno was getting sleepier
  and sleepier. “Sing, sing!” he murmured fretfully.
  Sylvie looked to me for instructions.
  “What shall it be?” she said.</p>
  <p>“Could you sing him the nursery-song you
  once told me of?” I suggested. “The one
  that had been put through the mind-mangle,
  you know. ‘<i>The little man that had a little
  gun</i>,’ I think it was.”</p>
  <p>“Why, that are one of the <i>Professor’s</i>
  songs!” cried Bruno. “I likes the little man;
  and I likes the way they spinned him——like a
  teetle-totle-tum.” And he turned a loving look
  on the gentle old man who was sitting at the
  other side of his leaf-bed, and who instantly
  began to sing, accompanying himself on his
  Outlandish guitar, while the snail, on which he
  sat, waved its horns in time to the music.</p>

  she demanded imperiously.</p>
  <p>“Something about a duck?” I hazarded.
  “Well, a bird of some kind?” I corrected
  myself, perceiving at once that <i>that</i> guess was
  wrong, at any rate.</p>
  <p>“<i>Something about a bird of some kind!</i>”
  Lady Muriel repeated, with as much withering
  scorn as her sweet face was capable of conveying.
  “And that’s the way he speaks of
  Shelley’s Sky-Lark, is it? When the Poet
  particularly says ‘<i>Hail to thee, blithe spirit!</i>

  <p>She led the way to the smoking-room, where,
  ignoring all the usages of Society and all the
  instincts of Chivalry, the three Lords of the
  Creation reposed at their ease in low rocking-chairs,
  and permitted the one lady who was
  present to glide gracefully about among us,
  supplying our wants in the form of cooling
  drinks, cigarettes, and lights. Nay, it was only
  <i>one</i> of the three who had the chivalry to go
  <span class="pb" id="Page_272">272</span>
  beyond the common-place “thank you,” and to
  quote the Poet’s exquisite description of how
  Geraint, when waited on by Enid, was moved</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb</p>
  <p class="t0">That crossed the platter as she laid it down,”</p>
  </div>
  <p>and to suit the action to the word—an audacious
  liberty for which, I feel bound to report,
  he was <i>not</i> duly reprimanded.</p>
  <p>As no topic of conversation seemed to occur
  to any one, and as we were, all four, on those
  delightful terms with one another (the only
  terms, I think, on which any friendship, that
  deserves the name of <i>intimacy</i>, can be maintained)
  which involve no sort of necessity for
  <i>speaking</i> for mere speaking’s sake, we sat in
  silence for some minutes.</p>
  <p>At length I broke the silence by asking “Is
  there any fresh news from the harbour about
  the Fever?”</p>
  <p>“None since this morning,” the Earl said,
  looking very grave. “But that was alarming
  enough. The Fever is spreading fast: the
  London doctor has taken fright and left the
  place, and the only one now available isn’t a
  <span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
  regular doctor at all: he is apothecary, and
  doctor, and dentist, and I don’t know what
  other trades, all in one. It’s a bad outlook
  for those poor fishermen—and a worse one
  for all the women and children.”</p>
  <p>“How many are there of them altogether?”
  Arthur asked.</p>
  <p>“There were nearly one hundred, a week
  ago.” said the Earl: “but there have been
  twenty or thirty deaths since then.”</p>
  <p>“And what religious ministrations are there
  to be had?”</p>
  <p>“There are three brave men down there,”
  the Earl replied, his voice trembling with emotion,
  “gallant heroes as ever won the Victoria
  Cross! I am certain that no one of the three
  will ever leave the place merely to save his
  own life. There’s the Curate: his wife is with
  him: they have no children. Then there’s the
  Roman Catholic Priest. And there’s the Wesleyan
  Minister. They go amongst their own
  flocks, mostly; but I’m told that those who
  are dying like to have <i>any</i> of the three with
  them. How slight the barriers seem to be
  that part Christian from Christian, when one
  <span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
  has to deal with the great facts of Life and the
  reality of Death!”</p>
  <p>“So it must be, and so it should be——”
  Arthur was beginning, when the front-door
  bell rang, suddenly and violently.</p>
  <p>We heard the front-door hastily opened, and
  voices outside: then a knock at the door of
  the smoking-room, and the old house-keeper
  appeared, looking a little scared.</p>
  <p>“Two persons, my Lord, to speak with Dr.
  Forester.”</p>
  <p>Arthur stepped outside at once, and we heard
  his cheery “Well, my men?” but the answer
  was less audible, the only words I could distinctly
  catch being “ten since morning, and two
  more just——”</p>
  <p>“But there <i>is</i> a doctor there?” we heard
  Arthur say: and a deep voice, that we had not
  heard before, replied “Dead, Sir. Died three
  hours ago.”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel shuddered, and hid her face in
  her hands: but at this moment the front-door
  was quietly closed, and we heard no more.</p>
  <p>For a few minutes we sat quite silent: then
  the Earl left the room, and soon returned to
  <span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
  tell us that Arthur had gone away with the
  two fishermen, leaving word that he would
  be back in about an hour. And, true enough,
  at the end of that interval—during which
  very little was said, none of us seeming to
  have the heart to talk—the front-door once
  more creaked on its rusty hinges, and a step
  was heard in the passage, hardly to be recognised
  as Arthur’s, so slow and uncertain was
  it, like a blind man feeling his way.</p>
  <p>He came in, and stood before Lady Muriel,
  resting one hand heavily on the table, and
  with a strange look in his eyes, as if he were
  walking in his sleep.</p>
  <p>“Muriel—my love——” he paused, and his
  lips quivered: but after a minute he went on
  more steadily. “Muriel—my darling—they—<i>want</i>
  me—down in the harbour.”</p>
  <p>“<i>Must</i> you go?” she pleaded, rising and
  laying her hands on his shoulders, and looking
  up into his face with her great eyes brimming
  over with tears. “Must <i>you</i> go, Arthur? It
  may mean—death!”</p>
  <p>He met her gaze without flinching. “It
  <i>does</i> mean death,” he said, in a husky whisper:
  <span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
  “but—darling—I am <i>called</i>. And even my
  life itself——” His voice failed him, and he
  said no more.</p>
  <p>For a minute she stood quite silent, looking
  upwards with a helpless gaze, as if even prayer
  were now useless, while her features worked
  and quivered with the great agony she was
  enduring. Then a sudden inspiration seemed
  to come upon her and light up her face with
  a strange sweet smile. “<i>Your</i> life?” she repeated.
  “It is not <i>yours</i> to give!”</p>
  <p>Arthur had recovered himself by this time,
  and could reply quite firmly, “That is true,” he
  said. “It is not <i>mine</i> to give. It is <i>yours</i>, now,
  my—wife that is to be! And you—do <i>you</i>
  forbid me to go? Will you not spare me, my
  own beloved one?”</p>
  <p>Still clinging to him, she laid her head softly
  on his breast. She had never done such a
  thing in my presence before, and I knew how
  deeply she must be moved. “I <i>will</i> spare you,”
  she said, calmly and quietly, “to God.”</p>
  <p>“And to God’s poor,” he whispered.</p>
  <p>“And to God’s poor,” she added. “When
  must it be, sweet love?”</p>

  <p>“To-morrow morning,” he replied. “And I
  have much to do before then.”</p>
  <p>And then he told us how he had spent his
  hour of absence. He had been to the Vicarage,
  and had arranged for the wedding to take place
  at eight the next morning (there was no legal
  obstacle, as he had, some time before this,

  we knew so well. “My old friend here,”
  indicating me, “will act as ‘Best Man,’ I know:
  your father will be there to give you away:
  and—and—you will dispense with bride’s-maids,
  my darling?”</p>
  <p>She nodded: no words came.</p>
  <p>“And then I can go with a willing heart—to
  do God’s work—knowing that we are <i>one</i>—and
  that we are together in <i>spirit</i>, though
  not in bodily presence—and are most of all
  together when we pray! Our <i>prayers</i> will go
  up together——”</p>
  <p>“Yes, yes!” sobbed Lady Muriel. “But
  you must not stay longer now, my darling!
  Go home and take some rest. You will need
  all your strength to-morrow——”</p>
  <p>“Well, I will go,” said Arthur. “We will
  be here in good time to-morrow. Good night,
  my own own darling!”</p>
  <p>I followed his example, and we two left the
  house together. As we walked back to our
  lodgings, Arthur sighed deeply once or twice,
  and seemed about to speak—but no words
  came, till we had entered the house, and had
  lit our candles, and were at our bedroom-doors.
  <span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
  Then Arthur said “Good night, old
  fellow! God bless you!”</p>
  <p>“God bless you!” I echoed, from the very
  depths of my heart.</p>
  <p>We were back again at the Hall by eight in
  the morning, and found Lady Muriel and the
  Earl, and the old Vicar, waiting for us. It was
  a strangely sad and silent party that walked up
  to the little church and back; and I could not
  help feeling that it was much more like a funeral
  than a wedding: to Lady Muriel it <i>was</i> in fact, a
  funeral rather than a wedding, so heavily did
  the presentiment weigh upon her (as she told
  us afterwards) that her newly-won husband was
  going forth to his death.</p>
  <p>Then we had breakfast; and, all too soon,
  the vehicle was at the door, which was to convey
  Arthur, first to his lodgings, to pick up the
  things he was taking with him, and then as
  far towards the death-stricken hamlet as it was
  considered safe to go. One or two of the
  fishermen were to meet him on the road, to
  carry his things the rest of the way.</p>
  <p>“And are you quite sure you are taking all
  that you will need?” Lady Muriel asked.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_280">280</div>
  <p>“All that I shall need as a <i>doctor</i>, certainly.
  And my own personal needs are few: I shall
  not even take any of my own wardrobe—there
  is a fisherman’s suit, ready-made, that
  is waiting for me at my lodgings. I shall
  only take my watch, and a few books, and—stay—there
  <i>is</i> one book I should like to add,
  a pocket-Testament—to use at the bedsides
  of the sick and dying——”</p>
  <p>“Take mine!” said Lady Muriel: and she
  ran upstairs to fetch it. “It has nothing
  written in it but ‘Muriel,’” she said as she
  returned with it: “shall I inscribe——”</p>
  <p>“No, my own one,” said Arthur, taking it
  from her. “What <i>could</i> you inscribe better
  than that? Could any human name mark it
  more clearly as my own individual property?
  Are <i>you</i> not mine? Are you not,” (with all
  the old playfulness of manner) “as Bruno
  would say, ‘my <i>very mine</i>’?”</p>
  <p>He bade a long and loving adieu to the
  Earl and to me, and left the room, accompanied
  only by his wife, who was bearing up bravely,
  and was—<i>outwardly</i>, at least—less overcome
  than her old father. We waited in the room a
  <span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
  minute or two, till the sound of wheels had told
  us that Arthur had driven away; and even
  then we waited still, for the step of Lady
  Muriel, going upstairs to her room, to die away
  in the distance. Her step, usually so light
  and joyous, now sounded slow and weary, like
  one who plods on under a load of hopeless
  misery; and I felt almost as hopeless, and
  almost as wretched, as she. “Are we four
  destined <i>ever</i> to meet again, on this side the
  grave?” I asked myself, as I walked to my
  home. And the tolling of a distant bell seemed
  to answer me, “No! No! No!”</p>

  <br><span class="small">A NEWSPAPER-CUTTING.</span></h2>
  <p class="center"><i>EXTRACT FROM THE “FAYFIELD CHRONICLE.”</i></p>
  <p><i>Our readers will have followed with painful
  interest, the accounts we have from time to time
  published of the terrible epidemic which has,
  during the last two months, carried off most of
  the inhabitants of the little fishing-harbour adjoining
  the village of Elveston. The last survivors,
  numbering twenty-three only, out of a
  population which, three short months ago, exceeded
  one hundred and twenty, were removed
  on Wednesday last, under the authority of the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
  Local Board, and safely lodged in the County
  Hospital: and the place is now veritably ‘a city
  of the dead,’ without a single human voice to
  break its silence.</i></p>
  <p><i>The rescuing party consisted of six sturdy
  fellows—fishermen from the neighbourhood—directed
  by the resident Physician of the Hospital,
  who came over for that purpose, heading a
  train of hospital-ambulances. The six men had
  been selected—from a much larger number who
  had volunteered for this peaceful ‘forlorn hope’—for
  their strength and robust health, as the
  expedition was considered to be, even now, when
  the malady has expended its chief force, not
  unattended with danger.</i></p>
  <p><i>Every precaution that science could suggest,
  against the risk of infection, was adopted: and
  the sufferers were tenderly carried on litters,
  one by one, up the steep hill, and placed in the
  ambulances which, each provided with a hospital
  nurse, were waiting on the level road. The
  fifteen miles, to the Hospital, were done at a
  walking-pace, as some of the patients were in too
  prostrate a condition to bear jolting, and the
  journey occupied the whole afternoon.</i></p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_284">284</div>
  <p><i>The twenty-three patients consist of nine men,
  six women, and eight children. It has not been
  found possible to identify them all, as some of
  the children—left with no surviving relatives—are
  infants; and two men and one woman
  are not yet able to make rational replies, the
  brain-powers being entirely in abeyance. Among
  a more well-to-do-race, there would no doubt
  have been names marked on the clothes; but
  here no such evidence is forthcoming.</i></p>
  <p><i>Besides the poor fishermen and their families,
  there were but five persons to be accounted for:
  and it was ascertained, beyond a doubt, that all
  five are numbered with the dead. It is a melancholy
  pleasure to place on record the names of
  these genuine martyrs—than whom none, surely,
  are more worthy to be entered on the glory-roll
  of England’s heroes! They are as follows:—</i></p>
  <p><i>The Rev. James Burgess, M.A., and Emma
  his wife. He was the Curate at the Harbour,
  not thirty years old, and had been married only
  two years. A written record was found in
  their house, of the dates of their deaths.</i></p>
  <p><i>Next to theirs we will place the honoured
  name of Dr. Arthur Forester, who, on the death
  <span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
  of the local physician, nobly faced the imminent
  peril of death, rather than leave these poor folk
  uncared for in their last extremity. No record
  of his name, or of the date of his death, was
  found: but the corpse was easily identified,
  although dressed in the ordinary fisherman’s
  suit (which he was known to have adopted when
  he went down there), by a copy of the New
  Testament, the gift of his wife, which was
  found, placed next his heart, with his hands
  crossed over it. It was not thought prudent to
  remove the body, for burial elsewhere: and accordingly
  it was at once committed to the ground,
  along with four others found in different houses,
  with all due reverence. His wife, whose maiden
  name was Lady Muriel Orme, had been married
  to him on the very morning on which he undertook
  his self-sacrificing mission.</i></p>
  <p><i>Next we record the Rev. Walter Saunders,
  Wesleyan Minister. His death is believed to
  have taken place two or three weeks ago, as the
  words ‘Died October 5’ were found written on
  the wall of the room which he is known to have
  occupied—the house being shut up, and apparently
  not having been entered for some time.</i></p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
  <p><i>Last—though not a whit behind the other
  four in glorious self-denial and devotion to duty—let
  us record the name of Father Francis,
  a young Jesuit Priest who had been only a few
  months in the place. He had not been dead
  many hours when the exploring party came upon
  the body, which was identified, beyond the possibility
  of doubt, by the dress, and by the crucifix
  which was, like the young Doctor’s Testament,
  clasped closely to his heart.</i></p>
  <p><i>Since reaching the hospital, two of the men
  and one of the children have died. Hope is entertained
  for all the others: though there are
  two or three cases where the vital powers seem
  to be so entirely exhausted that it is but ‘hoping
  against hope’ to regard ultimate recovery as
  even possible.</i></p>

  <h2 id="c19">CHAPTER XIX.
  <br><span class="small">A FAIRY-DUET.</span></h2>
  <p>The year—what an eventful year it had
  been for me!—was drawing to a close, and
  the brief wintry day hardly gave light enough
  to recognise the old familiar objects, bound up
  with so many happy memories, as the train
  glided round the last bend into the station,
  and the hoarse cry of “Elveston! Elveston!”
  resounded along the platform.</p>
  <p>It was sad to return to the place, and to
  feel that I should never again see the glad
  smile of welcome, that had awaited me here
  so few months ago. “And yet, if I were to
  <span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
  find him here,” I muttered, as in solitary state
  I followed the porter, who was wheeling my
  luggage on a barrow, “and if he <i>were</i> to ‘<i>strike
  a sudden hand in mine, And ask a thousand
  things of home</i>,’ I should not—no, ‘<i>I should
  not feel it to be strange</i>’!”</p>
  <p>Having given directions to have my luggage
  taken to my old lodgings, I strolled off alone,
  to pay a visit, before settling down in my own
  quarters, to my dear old friends—for such I
  indeed felt them to be, though it was barely
  half a year since first we met—the Earl and
  his widowed daughter.</p>
  <p>The shortest way, as I well remembered, was
  to cross through the churchyard. I pushed
  open the little wicket-gate and slowly took my
  way among the solemn memorials of the quiet
  dead, thinking of the many who had, during
  the past year, disappeared from the place, and
  had gone to ‘join the majority.’ A very few
  steps brought me in sight of the object of my
  search. Lady Muriel, dressed in the deepest
  mourning, her face hidden by a long crape veil,
  was kneeling before a little marble cross, round
  which she was fastening a wreath of flowers.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
  <p>The cross stood on a piece of level turf, unbroken
  by any mound, and I knew that it was
  simply a memorial-cross, for one whose dust
  reposed elsewhere, even before reading the
  simple inscription:—</p>
  <p class="center"><i>In loving Memory of</i>
  <br>ARTHUR FORESTER, M.D.
  <br><i>whose mortal remains lie buried by the sea:
  <br>whose spirit has returned to God who gave it</i>.</p>
  <p class="center"><i class="b">“Greater love hath no man than this, that
  <br>a man lay down his life for his friends.”</i></p>
  <p>She threw back her veil on seeing me approach,
  and came forwards to meet me, with a
  quiet smile, and far more self-possessed than I
  could have expected.</p>
  <p>“It is quite like old times, seeing <i>you</i> here
  again!” she said, in tones of genuine pleasure.
  “Have you been to see my father?”</p>
  <p>“No,” I said: “I was on my way there, and
  came through here as the shortest way. I
  hope he is well, and you also?”</p>
  <p>“Thanks, we are both quite well. And you?
  Are you any better yet?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_290">290</div>
  <p>“Not much better, I fear: but no worse, I
  am thankful to say.”</p>
  <p>“Let us sit here awhile, and have a quiet
  chat,” she said. The calmness—almost indifference—of
  her manner quite took me by
  surprise. I little guessed what a fierce restraint
  she was putting upon herself.</p>
  <p>“One can be so quiet here,” she resumed.
  “I come here every—every day.”</p>
  <p>“It is very peaceful,” I said.</p>
  <p>“You got my letter?”</p>
  <p>“Yes, but I delayed writing. It is so hard
  to say—on <i>paper</i>—”</p>
  <p>“I know. It was kind of you. You were
  with us when we saw the last of——” She
  paused a moment, and went on more hurriedly.
  “I went down to the harbour several times,
  but no one knows which of those vast graves it
  is. However, they showed me the house he
  died in: that was some comfort. I stood in the
  very room where—where——.” She struggled
  in vain to go on. The flood-gates had
  given way at last, and the outburst of grief was
  the most terrible I had ever witnessed. Totally
  regardless of my presence, she flung herself
  <span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
  down on the turf, burying her face in the grass,
  and with her hands clasped round the little
  marble cross, “Oh, my darling, my darling!”
  she sobbed. “And God meant your life to be
  so beautiful!”</p>
  <div class="img" id="fig27">
  <img alt="IN THE CHURCH-YARD" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i291.jpg" id="id-7225718931053675333" width="500" height="453">
  <p class="center small">IN THE CHURCH-YARD</p>
  </div>
  <p>I was startled to hear, thus repeated by Lady
  Muriel, the very words of the darling child
  whom I had seen weeping so bitterly over
  the dead hare. Had some mysterious influence
  passed, from that sweet fairy-spirit, ere
  <span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
  she went back to Fairyland, into the human
  spirit that loved her so dearly? The idea
  seemed too wild for belief. And yet, are there
  not ‘<i>more things in heaven and earth than
  are dreamt of in our philosophy</i>’?</p>
  <p>“God <i>meant</i> it to be beautiful,” I whispered,
  “and surely it <i>was</i> beautiful? God’s purpose
  never fails!” I dared say no more, but rose
  and left her. At the entrance-gate to the
  Earl’s house I waited, leaning on the gate and
  watching the sun set, revolving many memories—some
  happy, some sorrowful—until Lady
  Muriel joined me.</p>
  <p>She was quite calm again now. “Do come
  in,” she said. “My father will be so pleased
  to see you!”</p>
  <p>The old man rose from his chair, with a smile,
  to welcome me; but his self-command was far
  less than his daughter’s, and the tears coursed
  down his face as he grasped both my hands
  in his, and pressed them warmly.</p>
  <p>My heart was too full to speak; and we all
  sat silent for a minute or two. Then Lady
  Muriel rang the bell for tea. “You <i>do</i> take
  five o’clock tea, I know!” she said to me,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
  with the sweet playfulness of manner I remembered
  so well, “even though you <i>ca’n’t</i> work
  your wicked will on the Law of Gravity, and
  make the teacups descend into Infinite Space,
  a little faster than the tea!”</p>
  <p>This remark gave the tone to our conversation.
  By a tacit mutual consent, we avoided,
  during this our first meeting after her great
  sorrow, the painful topics that filled our thoughts,
  and talked like light-hearted children who had
  never known a care.</p>
  <p>“Did you ever ask yourself the question,”
  Lady Muriel began, <i>à propos</i> of nothing,
  “what is the <i>chief</i> advantage of being a Man
  instead of a Dog?”</p>
  <p>“No, indeed,” I said: “but I think there
  are advantages on the <i>Dog’s</i> side of the
  question, as well.”</p>
  <p>“No doubt,” she replied, with that pretty
  mock-gravity that became her so well: “but,
  on <i>Man’s</i> side, the chief advantage seems to
  me to consist in <i>having pockets</i>! It was borne
  in upon me—upon <i>us</i>, I should say; for my
  father and I were returning from a walk—only
  yesterday. We met a dog carrying home
  <span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
  a bone. What it wanted it for, I’ve no idea:
  certainly there was no <i>meat</i> on it——”</p>
  <p>A strange sensation came over me, that I
  had heard all this, or something exactly like
  it, before: and I almost expected her next
  words to be “perhaps he meant to make a
  cloak for the winter?” However what she
  really said was “and my father tried to account
  for it by some wretched joke about <i>pro
  bono publico</i>. Well, the dog laid down the
  bone—<i>not</i> in disgust with the pun, which
  would have shown it to be a dog of taste—but
  simply to rest its jaws, poor thing! I
  <i>did</i> pity it so! Won’t you join my <i>Charitable
  Association for supplying dogs with pockets</i>?
  How would <i>you</i> like to have to carry your
  walking-stick in your mouth?”</p>
  <p>Ignoring the difficult question as to the
  <i>raison d’être</i> of a walking-stick, supposing one
  had no <i>hands</i>, I mentioned a curious instance,
  I had once witnessed, of reasoning by a dog.
  A gentleman, with a lady, and child, and a
  large dog, were down at the end of a pier on
  which I was walking. To amuse his child,
  I suppose, the gentleman put down on the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
  ground his umbrella and the lady’s parasol,
  and then led the way to the other end of the
  pier, from which he sent the dog back for the
  deserted articles. I was watching with some
  curiosity. The dog came racing back to where
  I stood, but found an unexpected difficulty in
  picking up the things it had come for. With
  the umbrella in its mouth, its jaws were so
  far apart that it could get no firm grip on the
  parasol. After two or three failures, it paused
  and considered the matter.</p>
  <p>Then it put down the umbrella and began
  with the parasol. Of course that didn’t open
  its jaws nearly so wide, and it was able to
  get a good hold of the umbrella, and galloped
  off in triumph. One couldn’t doubt that it had
  gone through a real train of logical thought.</p>
  <p>“I entirely agree with you,” said Lady
  Muriel: “but don’t orthodox writers condemn
  that view, as putting Man on the level of the
  lower animals? Don’t they draw a sharp
  boundary-line between Reason and Instinct?”</p>
  <p>“That certainly <i>was</i> the orthodox view, a
  generation ago,” said the Earl. “The truth
  of Religion seemed ready to stand or fall with
  <span class="pb" id="Page_296">296</span>
  the assertion that Man was the only reasoning
  animal. But that is at an end now. Man can
  still claim <i>certain</i> monopolies—for instance,
  such a use of <i>language</i> as enables us to utilise
  the work of many, by ‘division of labour.’
  But the belief, that we have a monopoly of
  <i>Reason</i>, has long been swept away. Yet no
  catastrophe has followed. As some old poet
  says, ‘<i>God is where he was</i>.’”</p>
  <p>“Most religious believers would <i>now</i> agree
  with Bishop Butler,” said I, “and not reject
  a line of argument, even if it led straight to
  the conclusion that animals have some kind
  of <i>soul</i>, which survives their bodily death.”</p>
  <p>“I <i>would</i> like to know <i>that</i> to be true!”
  Lady Muriel exclaimed. “If only for the sake
  of the poor horses. Sometimes I’ve thought
  that, if anything <i>could</i> make me cease to believe
  in a God of perfect justice, it would be
  the sufferings of horses—without guilt to deserve
  it, and without any compensation!”</p>
  <p>“It is only part of the great Riddle,” said
  the Earl, “why innocent beings <i>ever</i> suffer. It
  <i>is</i> a great strain on Faith—but not a <i>breaking</i>
  strain, I think.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_297">297</div>
  <p>“The sufferings of <i>horses</i>,” I said, “are
  chiefly caused by <i>Man’s</i> cruelty. So <i>that</i> is
  merely one of the many instances of Sin
  causing suffering to others than the Sinner
  himself. But don’t you find a <i>greater</i> difficulty
  in sufferings inflicted by animals upon
  each other? For instance, a cat playing with
  a mouse. Assuming it to have no <i>moral</i>
  responsibility, isn’t that a greater mystery
  than a man over-driving a horse?”</p>
  <p>“I think it <i>is</i>,” said Lady Muriel, looking a
  mute appeal to her father.</p>
  <p>“What right have we to make that assumption?”
  said the Earl. “<i>Many</i> of our religious
  difficulties are merely deductions from unwarranted
  assumptions. The wisest answer to
  most of them, is, I think, ‘<i>behold, we know not
  anything</i>.’”</p>
  <p>“You mentioned ‘division of labour,’ just
  now,” I said. “Surely it is carried to a
  wonderful perfection in a hive of bees?”</p>
  <p>“So wonderful—so entirely super-human—”
  said the Earl, “and so entirely inconsistent
  with the intelligence they show in other
  ways—that I feel no doubt at all that it is
  <span class="pb" id="Page_298">298</span>
  <i>pure</i> Instinct, and <i>not</i>, as some hold, a very
  high order of Reason. Look at the utter
  stupidity of a bee, trying to find its way out of
  an open window! It <i>doesn’t</i> try, in any reasonable
  sense of the word: it simply bangs
  itself about! We should call a puppy <i>imbecile</i>,
  that behaved so. And yet we are asked to
  believe that its intellectual level is above Sir
  Isaac Newton!”</p>
  <p>“Then you hold that <i>pure</i> Instinct contains
  no <i>Reason</i> at all?”</p>
  <p>“On the contrary,” said the Earl, “I hold
  that the work of a bee-hive involves Reason of
  the <i>highest</i> order. But none of it is done by
  the <i>Bee</i>. <i>God</i> has reasoned it all out, and has
  put into the mind of the Bee the <i>conclusions</i>,
  only, of the reasoning process.”</p>
  <p>“But how do their minds come to work
  <i>together</i>?” I asked.</p>
  <p>“What right have we to assume that they
  <i>have</i> minds?”</p>
  <p>“Special pleading, special pleading!” Lady
  Muriel cried, in a most unfilial tone of triumph.
  “Why, you yourself said, just now, ‘the mind
  of the Bee’!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_299">299</div>
  <p>“But I did <i>not</i> say ‘<i>minds</i>,’ my child,” the
  Earl gently replied. “It has occurred to me,
  as the most probable solution of the ‘Bee’-mystery,
  that a swarm of Bees <i>have only one
  mind among them</i>. We often see one mind
  animating a most complex collection of limbs
  and organs, <i>when joined together</i>. How do
  we know that any material connection is necessary?
  May not mere neighbourhood be
  enough? If so, a swarm of bees is simply a
  single animal whose many limbs are not quite
  close together!”</p>
  <p>“It is a bewildering thought,” I said, “and
  needs a night’s rest to grasp it properly. Reason
  and Instinct <i>both</i> tell me I ought to go
  home. So, good-night!”</p>
  <p>“I’ll ‘set’ you part of the way,” said Lady
  Muriel. “I’ve had no walk to-day. It will
  do me good, and I have more to say to you.
  Shall we go through the wood? It will be
  pleasanter than over the common, even though
  it <i>is</i> getting a little dark.”</p>
  <p>We turned aside into the shade of interlacing
  boughs, which formed an architecture of almost
  perfect symmetry, grouped into lovely groined
  <span class="pb" id="Page_300">300</span>
  arches, or running out, far as the eye could
  follow, into endless aisles, and chancels, and
  naves, like some ghostly cathedral, fashioned
  out of the dream of a moon-struck poet.</p>
  <p>“Always, in this wood,” she began after a
  pause (silence seemed natural in this dim
  solitude), “I begin thinking of Fairies! May
  I ask you a question?” she added hesitatingly.
  “Do you believe in Fairies?”</p>
  <p>The momentary impulse was so strong to
  tell her of my experiences in this very wood,
  that I had to make a real effort to keep back
  the words that rushed to my lips. “If you
  mean, by ‘believe,’ ‘believe in their <i>possible</i>
  existence,’ I say ‘Yes.’ For their <i>actual</i> existence,
  of course, one would need <i>evidence</i>.”</p>
  <p>“You were saying, the other day,” she went
  on, “that you would accept <i>anything</i>, on good
  evidence, that was not <i>à priori</i> impossible.
  And I think you named <i>Ghosts</i> as an instance
  of a <i>provable</i> phenomenon. Would <i>Fairies</i> be
  another instance?”</p>
  <p>“Yes, I think so.” And again it was hard
  to check the wish to say more: but I was not
  yet sure of a sympathetic listener.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_301">301</div>
  <p>“And have you any theory as to what sort
  of place they would occupy in Creation? Do
  tell me what you think about them! Would
  they, for instance (supposing such beings to
  exist), would they have any moral responsibility?
  I mean” (and the light bantering tone
  suddenly changed to one of deep seriousness)
  “would they be capable of <i>sin</i>?”</p>
  <p>“They can reason—on a lower level, perhaps,
  than men and women—never rising, I
  think, above the faculties of a child; and they
  have a moral sense, most surely. Such a
  being, without <i>free will</i>, would be an absurdity.
  So I am driven to the conclusion that they
  <i>are</i> capable of sin.”</p>
  <p>“You believe in them?” she cried delightedly,
  with a sudden motion as if about to
  clap her hands. “Now tell me, have you any
  reason for it?”</p>
  <p>And still I strove to keep back the revelation
  I felt sure was coming. “I believe that
  there is <i>life</i> everywhere—not <i>material</i> only,
  not merely what is palpable to our senses—but
  immaterial and invisible as well. We believe
  in our own immaterial essence—call it ‘soul,’
  <span class="pb" id="Page_302">302</span>
  or ‘spirit,’ or what you will. Why should not
  other similar essences exist around us, <i>not</i>
  linked on to a visible and <i>material</i> body?
  Did not God make this swarm of happy insects,
  to dance in this sunbeam for one hour of
  bliss, for no other object, that we can imagine,
  than to swell the sum of conscious happiness?
  And where shall we dare to draw the line, and
  say ‘He has made all these and no more’?”</p>
  <p>“Yes, yes!” she assented, watching me with
  sparkling eyes. “But these are only reasons
  for not <i>denying</i>. You have more reasons than
  this, have you not?”</p>
  <p>“Well, yes,” I said, feeling I might safely
  tell all now. “And I could not find a fitter
  time or place to say it. I have <i>seen</i> them—and
  in this very wood!”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel asked no more questions. Silently
  she paced at my side, with head bowed
  down and hands clasped tightly together.
  Only, as my tale went on, she drew a little
  short quick breath now and then, like a child
  panting with delight. And I told her what I
  had never yet breathed to any other listener,
  of my double life, and, more than that (for
  <span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
  <i>mine</i> might have been but a noonday-dream),
  of the double life of those two dear children.</p>
  <p>And when I told her of Bruno’s wild gambols,
  she laughed merrily; and when I spoke of
  Sylvie’s sweetness and her utter unselfishness
  and trustful love, she drew a deep breath, like
  one who hears at last some precious tidings for
  which the heart has ached for a long while;
  and the happy tears chased one another down
  her cheeks.</p>
  <p>“I have often longed to meet an angel,” she
  whispered, so low that I could hardly catch the
  words. “I’m <i>so</i> glad I’ve seen Sylvie! My
  heart went out to the child the first moment
  that I saw her—— Listen!” she broke off
  suddenly. “That’s Sylvie singing! I’m sure
  of it! Don’t you know her voice?”</p>
  <p>“I have heard <i>Bruno</i> sing, more than once,”
  I said: “but I never heard Sylvie.”</p>
  <p>“I have only heard her <i>once</i>,” said Lady
  Muriel. “It was that day when you brought
  us those mysterious flowers. The children
  had run out into the garden; and I saw Eric
  coming in that way, and went to the window
  to meet him: and Sylvie was singing, under
  <span class="pb" id="Page_304">304</span>
  the trees, a song I had never heard before.
  The words were something like ‘I think it is
  Love, I feel it is Love.’ Her voice sounded
  far away, like a dream, but it was beautiful
  beyond all words—as sweet as an infant’s
  first smile, or the first gleam of the white cliffs
  when one is coming <i>home</i> after weary years—a
  voice that seemed to fill one’s whole
  being with peace and heavenly thoughts—— Listen!”
  she cried, breaking off again in her
  excitement. “That <i>is</i> her voice, and that’s
  the very song!”</p>
  <p>I could distinguish no words, but there was
  a dreamy sense of music in the air that seemed
  to grow ever louder and louder, as if coming
  nearer to us. We stood quite silent, and in
  another minute the two children appeared,
  coming straight towards us through an arched
  opening among the trees. Each had an arm
  round the other, and the setting sun shed a
  golden halo round their heads, like what one
  sees in pictures of saints. They were looking
  in our direction, but evidently did not see us,
  and I soon made out that Lady Muriel had
  for once passed into a condition familiar to
  <i>me</i>, that we were both of us ‘eerie,’ and that,
  though we could see the children so plainly,
  we were quite invisible to <i>them</i>.</p>
  <div class="img" id="fig28">
  <img alt="A FAIRY-DUET" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i303.jpg" id="id-1338397045280808781" width="500" height="739">
  <p class="center small">A FAIRY-DUET</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
  <p>The song ceased just as they came into
  sight: but, to my delight, Bruno instantly said
  “Let’s sing it all again, Sylvie! It <i>did</i> sound
  so pretty!” And Sylvie replied “Very well.
  It’s <i>you</i> to begin, you know.”</p>
  <p>So Bruno began, in the sweet childish treble
  I knew so well:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“Say, what is the spell, when her fledgelings are cheeping,</p>
  <p class="t">That lures the bird home to her nest?</p>
  <p class="t0">Or wakes the tired mother, whose infant is weeping,</p>
  <p class="t">To cuddle and croon it to rest?</p>
  <p class="t0">What’s the magic that charms the glad babe in her arms,</p>
  <p class="t">Till it cooes with the voice of the dove?”</p>
  </div>
  <p>And now ensued quite the strangest of all
  the strange experiences that marked the wonderful
  year whose history I am writing—the
  experience of <i>first</i> hearing Sylvie’s voice in
  song. Her part was a very short one—only a
  few words—and she sang it timidly, and very
  low indeed, scarcely audibly, but the <i>sweetness</i>
  <span class="pb" id="Page_306">306</span>
  of her voice was simply indescribable; I have
  never heard any earthly music like it.</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“’Tis a secret, and so let us whisper it low—</p>
  <p class="t">And the name of the secret is Love!”</p>
  </div>
  <p>On me the first effect of her voice was a
  sudden sharp pang that seemed to pierce
  through one’s very heart. (I had felt such a
  pang only once before in my life, and it had
  been from <i>seeing</i> what, at the moment, realised
  one’s idea of perfect beauty—it was in a
  London exhibition, where, in making my way
  through a crowd, I suddenly met, face to face,
  a child of quite unearthly beauty.) Then came
  a rush of burning tears to the eyes, as though
  one could weep one’s soul away for pure delight.
  And lastly there fell on me a sense of
  awe that was almost terror—some such feeling
  as Moses must have had when he heard the
  words “<i>Put off thy shoes from off thy feet,
  for the place whereon thou standest is holy
  ground</i>.” The figures of the children became
  vague and shadowy, like glimmering
  meteors: while their voices rang together in
  exquisite harmony as they sang:—</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_307">307</div>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t2">“For I think it is Love,</p>
  <p class="t2">For I feel it is Love,</p>
  <p class="t0">For I’m sure it is nothing but Love!”</p>
  </div>
  <p>By this time I could see them clearly once
  more. Bruno again sang by himself:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“Say, whence is the voice that, when anger is burning,</p>
  <p class="t">Bids the whirl of the tempest to cease?</p>
  <p class="t0">That stirs the vexed soul with an aching—a yearning</p>
  <p class="t">For the brotherly hand-grip of peace?</p>
  <p class="t0">Whence the music that fills all our being—that thrills</p>
  <p class="t">Around us, beneath, and above?”</p>
  </div>
  <p>Sylvie sang more courageously, this time:
  the words seemed to carry her away, out of
  herself:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“’Tis a secret: none knows how it comes, how it goes:</p>
  <p class="t">But the name of the secret is Love!”</p>
  </div>
  <p>And clear and strong the chorus rang out:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t2">“For I think it is Love,</p>
  <p class="t2">For I feel it is Love,</p>
  <p class="t0">For I’m sure it is nothing but Love!”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
  <p>Once more we heard Bruno’s delicate little
  voice alone:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“Say whose is the skill that paints valley and hill,</p>
  <p class="t">Like a picture so fair to the sight?</p>
  <p class="t0">That flecks the green meadow with sunshine and shadow,</p>
  <p class="t">Till the little lambs leap with delight?”</p>
  </div>
  <p>And again uprose that silvery voice, whose
  angelic sweetness I could hardly bear:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“’Tis a secret untold to hearts cruel and cold,</p>
  <p class="t">Though ’tis sung, by the angels above,</p>
  <p class="t0">In notes that ring clear for the ears that can hear—</p>
  <p class="t">And the name of the secret is Love!”</p>
  </div>
  <p>And then Bruno joined in again with</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t2">“For I think it is Love,</p>
  <p class="t2">For I feel it is Love,</p>
  <p class="t0">For I’m sure it is nothing but Love!”</p>
  </div>
  <p>“That <i>are</i> pretty!” the little fellow exclaimed,
  as the children passed us—so closely that we
  drew back a little to make room for them, and
  it seemed we had only to reach out a hand to
  touch them: but this we did not attempt.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
  <p>“No use to try and stop them!” I said, as
  they passed away into the shadows. “Why,
  they could not even <i>see</i> us!”</p>
  <p>“No use at all,” Lady Muriel echoed with a
  sigh. “One would <i>like</i> to meet them again, in
  living form! But I feel, somehow, <i>that</i> can
  never be. They have passed out of <i>our</i> lives!”
  She sighed again; and no more was said, till
  we came out into the main road, at a point
  near my lodgings.</p>
  <p>“Well, I will leave you here,” she said. “I
  want to get back before dark: and I have a
  cottage-friend to visit, first. Good night, dear
  friend! Let us see you soon—and often!”
  she added, with an affectionate warmth that
  went to my very heart. “<i>For those are few
  we hold as dear!</i>”</p>
  <p>“Good night!” I answered. “Tennyson
  said that of a worthier friend than me.”</p>
  <p>“Tennyson didn’t know what he was talking
  about!” she saucily rejoined, with a touch of
  her old childish gaiety; and we parted.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_310">310</div>
  <h2 id="c20">CHAPTER XX.
  <br><span class="small">GAMMON AND SPINACH.</span></h2>
  <p>My landlady’s welcome had an extra heartiness
  about it: and though, with a rare delicacy
  of feeling, she made no direct allusion to the
  friend whose companionship had done so much
  to brighten life for me, I felt sure that it was a
  kindly sympathy with my solitary state that
  made her so specially anxious to do all she
  could think of to ensure my comfort, and make
  me feel at home.</p>
  <p>The lonely evening seemed long and tedious:
  yet I lingered on, watching the dying fire, and
  letting Fancy mould the red embers into the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_311">311</span>
  forms and faces belonging to bygone scenes.
  Now it seemed to be Bruno’s roguish smile
  that sparkled for a moment, and died away:
  now it was Sylvie’s rosy cheek: and now the
  Professor’s jolly round face, beaming with delight.
  “You’re welcome, my little ones!” he
  seemed to say. And then the red coal, which
  for the moment embodied the dear old Professor,
  began to wax dim, and with its dying
  lustre the words seemed to die away into silence.
  I seized the poker, and with an artful
  touch or two revived the waning glow, while
  Fancy—no coy minstrel she—sang me once
  again the magic strain I loved to hear.</p>
  <p>“You’re welcome, little ones!” the cheery
  voice repeated. “I told them you were
  coming. Your rooms are all ready for you.
  And the Emperor and the Empress—well,
  I think they’re rather pleased than otherwise!
  In fact, Her Highness said ‘I hope they’ll be
  in time for the Banquet!’ Those were her
  very words, I assure you!”</p>
  <p>“Will Uggug be at the Banquet?” Bruno
  asked. And both children looked uneasy at the
  dismal suggestion.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
  <p>“Why, of course he will!” chuckled the Professor.
  “Why, it’s his <i>birthday</i>, don’t you
  know? And his health will be drunk, and all
  that sort of thing. What would the Banquet be
  without <i>him</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Ever so much nicer,” said Bruno. But he
  said it in a <i>very</i> low voice, and nobody but
  Sylvie heard him.</p>
  <p>The Professor chuckled again. “It’ll be a
  jolly Banquet, now <i>you’ve</i> come, my little man!
  I <i>am</i> so glad to see you again!”</p>
  <p>“I ’fraid we’ve been very long in coming,”
  Bruno politely remarked.</p>
  <p>“Well, yes,” the Professor assented. “However,
  you’re very short now you’re come: that’s
  <i>some</i> comfort.” And he went on to enumerate
  the plans for the day. “The Lecture comes
  first,” he said. “<i>That</i> the Empress <i>insists</i> on.
  She says people will eat so much at the Banquet,
  they’ll be too sleepy to attend to the
  Lecture afterwards—and perhaps she’s right.
  There’ll just be a little <i>refreshment</i>, when the
  people first arrive—as a kind of surprise
  for the Empress, you know. Ever since
  she’s been—well, not <i>quite</i> so clever as she
  <span class="pb" id="Page_313">313</span>
  once was—we’ve found it desirable to concoct
  little surprises for her. <i>Then</i> comes the
  Lecture——”</p>
  <p>“What? The Lecture you were getting
  ready—ever so long ago?” Sylvie enquired.</p>
  <p>“Yes—that’s the one,” the Professor rather
  reluctantly admitted. “It <i>has</i> taken a goodish
  time to prepare. I’ve got so many other
  things to attend to. For instance, I’m Court-Physician.
  I have to keep all the Royal
  Servants in good health—and that reminds
  me!” he cried, ringing the bell in a great
  hurry. “This is Medicine-Day! We only
  give Medicine once a week. If we were to
  begin giving it every day, the bottles would
  <i>soon</i> be empty!”</p>
  <p>“But if they were ill on the <i>other</i> days?”
  Sylvie suggested.</p>
  <p>“What, ill on the wrong <i>day</i>!” exclaimed
  the Professor. “Oh, that would never do!
  A Servant would be dismissed <i>at once</i>, who
  was ill on the wrong day! This is the Medicine
  for <i>today</i>,” he went on, taking down a
  large jug from a shelf. “I mixed it, myself,
  first thing this morning. Taste it!” he said,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
  holding out the jug to Bruno. “Dip in your
  finger, and taste it!”</p>
  <p>Bruno did so, and made such an excruciatingly
  wry face that Sylvie exclaimed, in
  alarm, “Oh, Bruno, you mustn’t!”</p>
  <p>“It’s welly extremely nasty!” Bruno said,
  as his face resumed its natural shape.</p>
  <p>“Nasty?” said the Professor. “Why, of
  <i>course</i> it is! What would Medicine be, if it
  wasn’t <i>nasty</i>?”</p>
  <p>“Nice,” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“I was going to say—” the Professor
  faltered, rather taken aback by the promptness
  of Bruno’s reply, “—that <i>that</i> would
  never do! Medicine <i>has</i> to be nasty, you
  know. Be good enough to take this jug,
  down into the Servants’ Hall,” he said to the
  footman who answered the bell: “and tell
  them it’s their Medicine for <i>today</i>.”</p>
  <p>“Which of them is to drink it?” the footman
  asked, as he carried off the jug.</p>
  <p>“Oh, I’ve not settled <i>that</i> yet!” the Professor
  briskly replied. “I’ll come and settle
  that, soon. Tell them not to begin, on any
  account, till I come! It’s really <i>wonderful</i>,”
  <span class="pb" id="Page_315">315</span>
  he said, turning to the children, “the success
  I’ve had in curing Diseases! Here are
  some of my memoranda.” He took down
  from the shelf a heap of little bits of paper,
  pinned together in twos and threes. “Just
  look at <i>this</i> set, now. ‘<i>Under-Cook Number
  Thirteen recovered from Common Fever—Febris
  Communis</i>.’ And now see what’s pinned
  to it. ‘<i>Gave Under-Cook Number Thirteen a
  Double Dose of Medicine</i>.’ <i>That’s</i> something
  to be proud of, <i>isn’t</i> it?”</p>
  <p>“But which happened <i>first</i>?” said Sylvie,
  looking very much puzzled.</p>
  <p>The Professor examined the papers carefully.
  “They are not <i>dated</i>, I find,” he said
  with a slightly dejected air: “so I fear I ca’n’t
  tell you. But they <i>both</i> happened: there’s no
  doubt of <i>that</i>. The <i>Medicine’s</i> the great thing,
  you know. The <i>Diseases</i> are much less important.
  You can keep a <i>Medicine</i>, for years
  and years: but nobody ever wants to keep
  a <i>Disease</i>! By the way, come and look at
  the platform. The Gardener asked me to
  come and see if it would do. We may as
  well go before it gets dark.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
  <p>“We’d like to, very much!” Sylvie replied.
  “Come, Bruno, put on your hat. Don’t keep
  the dear Professor waiting!”</p>
  <p>“Ca’n’t find my hat!” the little fellow sadly
  replied. “I were rolling it about. And it’s
  rolled itself away!”</p>
  <p>“Maybe it’s rolled in <i>there</i>,” Sylvie suggested,
  pointing to a dark recess, the door of
  which stood half open: and Bruno ran in to
  look. After a minute he came slowly out
  again, looking very grave, and carefully shut
  the cupboard-door after him.</p>
  <p>“It aren’t in there,” he said, with such unusual
  solemnity, that Sylvie’s curiosity was
  roused.</p>
  <p>“What <i>is</i> in there, Bruno?”</p>
  <p>“There’s cobwebs—and two spiders—”
  Bruno thoughtfully replied, checking off the
  catalogue on his fingers, “—and the cover
  of a picture-book—and a tortoise—and a
  dish of nuts—and an old man.”</p>
  <p>“An old man!” cried the Professor, trotting
  across the room in great excitement. “Why,
  it must be the Other Professor, that’s been lost
  for ever so long!”</p>

  <p class="center small">THE OTHER PROFESSOR FOUND</p>
  </div>
  <p>He opened the
  door of the cupboard
  wide: and
  there he was, the
  Other Professor,
  sitting in a chair,
  with a book on
  his knee, and in
  the act of helping
  himself to a
  nut from a dish,
  which he had taken
  down off a
  shelf just within
  his reach. He
  looked round at
  us, but said nothing till he had cracked and
  eaten the nut. Then he asked the old question.
  “Is the Lecture all ready?”</p>
  <p>“It’ll begin in an hour,” the Professor said,
  evading the question. “First, we must have
  something to surprise the Empress. And then
  comes the Banquet——”</p>
  <p>“The Banquet!” cried the Other Professor,
  springing up, and filling the room with a cloud
  <span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
  of dust. “Then I’d better go and—and brush
  myself a little. What a state I’m in!”</p>
  <p>“He <i>does</i> want brushing!” the Professor
  said, with a critical air, “Here’s your hat, little
  man! I had put it on by mistake. I’d quite
  forgotten I had <i>one</i> on, already. Let’s go
  and look at the platform.”</p>
  <p>“And there’s that nice old Gardener singing
  still!” Bruno exclaimed in delight, as we
  went out into the garden. “I do believe he’s
  been singing that very song ever since we
  went away!”</p>
  <p>“Why, of course he has!” replied the Professor.
  “It wouldn’t be the thing to leave off,
  you know.”</p>
  <p>“Wouldn’t be <i>what</i> thing?” said Bruno:
  but the Professor thought it best not to hear
  the question. “What are you doing with that
  hedgehog?” he shouted at the Gardener, whom
  they found standing upon one foot, singing
  softly to himself, and rolling a hedgehog up
  and down with the other foot.</p>
  <p>“Well, I wanted fur to know what hedgehogs
  lives on: so I be a-keeping this here
  hedgehog—fur to see if it eats potatoes——”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
  <p>“Much better keep a potato,” said the Professor;
  “and see if hedgehogs eat it!”</p>
  <p>“That be the roight way, sure-ly!” the delighted
  Gardener exclaimed. “Be you come
  to see the platform?”</p>
  <p>“Aye, aye!” the Professor cheerily replied.
  “And the children have come back, you see!”</p>
  <p>The Gardener looked round at them with a
  grin. Then he led the way to the Pavilion;
  and as he went he sang:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“He looked again, and found it was</p>
  <p class="t">A Double Rule of Three:</p>
  <p class="t0">‘And all its Mystery,’ he said,</p>
  <p class="t">‘Is clear as day to me!’”</p>
  </div>
  <p>“You’ve been <i>months</i> over that song,” said
  the Professor. “Isn’t it finished yet?”</p>
  <p>“There be only one verse more,” the Gardener
  sadly replied. And, with tears streaming
  down his cheeks, he sang the last verse:—</p>
  <div class="verse">
  <p class="t0">“He thought he saw an Argument</p>
  <p class="t">That proved he was the Pope:</p>
  <p class="t0">He looked again, and found it was</p>
  <p class="t">A Bar of Mottled Soap.</p>
  <p class="t0">‘A fact so dread,’ he faintly said,</p>
  <p class="t">‘Extinguishes all hope!’”</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_320">320</div>
  <p>Choking with sobs, the Gardener hastily
  stepped on a few yards ahead of the party,
  to conceal his emotion.</p>
  <p>“Did <i>he</i> see the Bar of Mottled Soap?”
  Sylvie enquired, as we followed.</p>
  <p>“Oh, certainly!” said the Professor. “That
  song is his own history, you know.”</p>
  <p>Tears of an ever-ready sympathy glittered
  in Bruno’s eyes. “I’s <i>welly</i> sorry he isn’t the
  Pope!” he said. “Aren’t <i>you</i> sorry, Sylvie?”</p>
  <p>“Well—I hardly know,” Sylvie replied in
  the vaguest manner. “Would it make him
  any happier?” she asked the Professor.</p>
  <p>“It wouldn’t make the <i>Pope</i> any happier,”
  said the Professor. “Isn’t the platform <i>lovely</i>?”
  he asked, as we entered the Pavilion.</p>
  <p>“I’ve put an extra beam under it!” said the
  Gardener, patting it affectionately as he spoke.
  “And now it’s that strong, as—as a mad
  elephant might dance upon it!”</p>
  <p>“Thank you <i>very</i> much!” the Professor
  heartily rejoined. “I don’t know that we shall
  exactly require—but it’s convenient to know.”
  And he led the children upon the platform, to
  explain the arrangements to them. “Here are
  <span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
  three seats, you see, for the Emperor and the
  Empress and Prince Uggug. But there must
  be two more chairs here!” he said, looking
  down at the Gardener. “One for Lady Sylvie,
  and one for the smaller animal!”</p>
  <p>“And may I help in the Lecture?” said
  Bruno. “I can do some conjuring-tricks.”</p>
  <p>“Well, it’s not exactly a <i>conjuring</i> lecture,”
  the Professor said, as he arranged some curious-looking
  machines on the table. “However,
  what can you do? Did you ever go through a
  table, for instance?”</p>
  <p>“Often!” said Bruno. “<i>Haven’t</i> I, Sylvie?”</p>
  <p>The Professor was evidently surprised, though
  he tried not to show it. “This must be looked
  into,” he muttered to himself, taking out a note-book.
  “And first—what kind of table?”</p>
  <p>“Tell him!” Bruno whispered to Sylvie,
  putting his arms round her neck.</p>
  <p>“Tell him yourself,” said Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“Ca’n’t,” said Bruno. “It’s a <i>bony</i> word.”</p>
  <p>“Nonsense!” laughed Sylvie. “You can
  say it well enough, if you only try. Come!”</p>
  <p>“Muddle—” said Bruno. “That’s a bit
  of it.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_322">322</div>
  <p>“<i>What</i> does he say?” cried the bewildered
  Professor.</p>
  <p>“He means the multiplication-table,” Sylvie
  explained.</p>
  <p>The Professor looked annoyed, and shut up
  his note-book again. “Oh, that’s <i>quite</i> another
  thing,” he said.</p>
  <p>“It are ever so many other things,” said
  Bruno. “<i>Aren’t</i> it, Sylvie?”</p>
  <p>A loud blast of trumpets interrupted this
  conversation. “Why, the entertainment has
  <i>begun</i>!” the Professor exclaimed, as he hurried
  the children into the Reception-Saloon.
  “I had no idea it was so late!”</p>
  <p>A small table, containing cake and wine,
  stood in a corner of the Saloon; and here we
  found the Emperor and Empress waiting for
  us. The rest of the Saloon had been cleared
  of furniture, to make room for the guests.
  I was much struck by the great change a few
  months had made in the faces of the Imperial
  Pair. A vacant stare was now the <i>Emperor’s</i>
  usual expression; while over the face
  of the <i>Empress</i> there flitted, ever and anon,
  a meaningless smile.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
  <p>“So you’re come at last!” the Emperor
  sulkily remarked, as the Professor and the
  children took their places. It was evident that
  he was <i>very</i> much out of temper: and we were
  not long in learning the cause of this. He did
  not consider the preparations, made for the
  Imperial party, to be such as suited their
  rank. “A common mahogany table!” he
  growled, pointing to it contemptuously with
  his thumb. “Why wasn’t it made of gold, I
  should like to know?”</p>
  <p>“It would have taken a very long——” the
  Professor began, but the Emperor cut the
  sentence short.</p>
  <p>“Then the cake! Ordinary plum! Why
  wasn’t it made of—of——” He broke off
  again. “Then the wine! Merely old Madeira!
  Why wasn’t it——? Then this chair! That’s
  worst of all. Why wasn’t it a throne? One
  <i>might</i> excuse the other omissions, but I <i>ca’n’t</i>
  get over the chair!”</p>
  <p>“What <i>I</i> ca’n’t get over,” said the Empress,
  in eager sympathy with her angry husband, “is
  the <i>table</i>!”</p>
  <p>“Pooh!” said the Emperor.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_324">324</div>
  <p>“It is much to be regretted!” the Professor
  mildly replied, as soon as he had a chance
  of speaking. After a moment’s thought he
  strengthened the remark. “<i>Everything</i>,” he
  said, addressing Society in general, “is <i>very
  much</i> to be regretted!”</p>
  <p>A murmur of “Hear, hear!” rose from the
  crowded Saloon.</p>
  <p>There was a rather awkward pause: the
  Professor evidently didn’t know how to begin.
  The Empress leant forwards, and whispered to
  him. “A few jokes, you know, Professor—just
  to put people at their ease!”</p>
  <p>“True, true, Madam!” the Professor meekly
  replied. “This little boy——”</p>
  <p>“<i>Please</i> don’t make any jokes about <i>me</i>!”
  Bruno exclaimed, his eyes filling with tears.</p>
  <p>“I won’t if you’d rather I didn’t,” said the
  kind-hearted Professor. “It was only something
  about a Ship’s Buoy: a harmless pun—but
  it doesn’t matter.” Here he turned to the
  crowd and addressed them in a loud voice.
  “Learn your A’s!” he shouted. “Your B’s!
  Your C’s! And your D’s! <i>Then</i> you’ll be at
  your ease!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_325">325</div>
  <p>There was a roar of laughter from all the
  assembly, and then a great deal of confused
  whispering. “<i>What</i> was it he said? Something
  about bees, I fancy——.”</p>
  <p>The Empress smiled in her meaningless
  way, and fanned herself. The poor Professor
  looked at her timidly: he was clearly at his
  wits’ end again, and hoping for another hint.
  The Empress whispered again.</p>
  <p>“Some spinach, you know, Professor, as a
  surprise.”</p>
  <p>The Professor beckoned to the Head-Cook,
  and said something to him in a low voice.
  Then the Head-Cook left the room, followed
  by all the other cooks.</p>
  <p>“It’s difficult to get things started,” the Professor
  remarked to Bruno. “When once we
  get started, it’ll go on all right, you’ll see.”</p>
  <p>“If oo want to startle people,” said Bruno,
  “oo should put live frogs on their backs.”</p>
  <p>Here the cooks all came in again, in a
  procession, the Head-Cook coming last and
  carrying something, which the others tried to
  hide by waving flags all round it. “Nothing
  but flags, Your Imperial Highness! Nothing
  but flags!” he kept repeating, as he set it
  before her. Then all the flags were dropped
  in a moment, as the Head-Cook raised the
  cover from an enormous dish.</p>

  <div class="pb" id="Page_327">327</div>
  <p>“What is it?” the Empress said faintly, as
  she put her spy-glass to her eye. “Why, it’s
  <i>Spinach</i>, I declare!”</p>
  <p>“Her Imperial Highness is surprised,” the
  Professor explained to the attendants: and
  some of them clapped their hands. The
  Head-Cook made a low bow, and in doing
  so dropped a spoon on the table, as if by
  accident, just within reach of the Empress,
  who looked the other way and pretended not
  to see it.</p>
  <p>“I <i>am</i> surprised!” the Empress said to
  Bruno. “Aren’t you?”</p>
  <p>“Not a bit,” said Bruno. “I heard——”
  but Sylvie put her hand over his mouth, and
  spoke for him. “He’s rather tired, I think.
  He wants the Lecture to begin.”</p>
  <p>“I want the <i>supper</i> to begin,” Bruno corrected
  her.</p>
  <p>The Empress took up the spoon in an
  absent manner, and tried to balance it across
  <span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
  the back of her hand, and in doing this she
  dropped it into the dish: and, when she took
  it out again, it was full of spinach. “How
  curious!” she said, and put it into her mouth.
  “It tastes just like <i>real</i> spinach! I thought it
  was an imitation—but I do believe it’s real!”
  And she took another spoonful.</p>
  <p>“It wo’n’t be real much longer,” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>But the Empress had had enough spinach
  by this time, and somehow—I failed to notice
  the exact process—we all found ourselves in
  the Pavilion, and the Professor in the act of
  beginning the long-expected Lecture.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_329">329</div>
  <h2 id="c21">CHAPTER XXI.
  <br><span class="small">THE PROFESSOR’S LECTURE.</span></h2>
  <p>“In Science—in fact, in most things—it is
  usually best <i>to begin at the beginning</i>. In <i>some</i>
  things, of course, it’s better to begin at the
  <i>other</i> end. For instance, if you wanted to
  paint a dog green, it <i>might</i> be best to begin
  with the <i>tail</i>, as it doesn’t bite at <i>that</i> end.
  And so——”</p>
  <p>“May <i>I</i> help oo?” Bruno interrupted.</p>
  <p>“Help me to do <i>what</i>?” said the puzzled
  Professor, looking up for a moment, but keeping
  his finger on the book he was reading from,
  so as not to lose his place.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_330">330</div>
  <p>“To paint a dog green!” cried Bruno. “<i>Oo</i>
  can begin wiz its <i>mouf</i>, and I’ll——”</p>
  <p>“No, no!” said the Professor. “We haven’t
  got to the <i>Experiments</i> yet. And so,” returning
  to his note-book, “I’ll give you the Axioms
  of Science. After that I shall exhibit some
  Specimens. Then I shall explain a Process or
  two. And I shall conclude with a few Experiments.
  An <i>Axiom</i>, you know, is a thing
  that you accept without contradiction. For
  instance, if I were to say ‘Here we are!’, that
  would be accepted without any contradiction,
  and it’s a nice sort of remark to <i>begin</i> a conversation
  with. So it would be an <i>Axiom</i>. Or
  again, supposing I were to say ‘Here we are
  not!’ <i>that</i> would be——”</p>
  <p>“—a fib!” cried Bruno.</p>
  <p>“Oh, <i>Bruno</i>!” said Sylvie in a warning
  whisper. “Of course it would be an <i>Axiom</i>,
  if the Professor said it!”</p>
  <p>“—that would be accepted, if people were
  civil,” continued the Professor; “so it would
  be <i>another</i> Axiom.”</p>
  <p>“It <i>might</i> be an Axledum,” Bruno said:
  “but it wouldn’t be <i>true</i>!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_331">331</div>
  <p>“Ignorance of Axioms,” the Lecturer continued,
  “is a great drawback in life. It wastes
  so much time to have to say them over and
  over again. For instance, take the Axiom ‘<i>Nothing
  is greater than itself</i>’; that is, ‘<i>Nothing
  can contain itself</i>.’ How often you hear people
  say ‘He was so excited, he was quite unable
  to contain himself,’ Why, <i>of course</i> he was
  unable! The <i>excitement</i> had nothing to do
  with it!”</p>
  <p>“I say, look here, you know!” said the
  Emperor, who was getting a little restless.
  “How many Axioms are you going to give
  us? At <i>this</i> rate, we sha’n’t get to the <i>Experiments</i>
  till to-morrow-week!”</p>
  <p>“Oh, sooner than <i>that</i>, I assure you!” the
  Professor replied, looking up in alarm. “There
  are only,” (he referred to his notes again) “only
  <i>two</i> more, that are really <i>necessary</i>.”</p>
  <p>“Read ’em out, and get on to the <i>Specimens</i>,”
  grumbled the Emperor.</p>
  <p>“The <i>First</i> Axiom,” the Professor read out
  in a great hurry, “consists of these words,
  ‘<i>Whatever is, is</i>.’ And the Second consists of
  <i>these</i> words, ‘<i>Whatever isn’t, isn’t</i>.’ We will
  <span class="pb" id="Page_332">332</span>
  now go on to the <i>Specimens</i>. The first tray
  contains Crystals and other Things.” He
  drew it towards him, and again referred to his
  note-book. “Some of the labels—owing to
  insufficient adhesion——” Here he stopped
  again, and carefully examined the page with
  his eyeglass. “I ca’n’t quite read the rest of
  the sentence,” he said at last, “but it <i>means</i>
  that the labels have come loose, and the Things
  have got mixed——”</p>
  <p>“Let <i>me</i> stick ’em on again!” cried Bruno
  eagerly, and began licking them, like postage-stamps,
  and dabbing them down upon the Crystals
  and the other Things. But the Professor
  hastily moved the tray out of his reach. “They
  <i>might</i> get fixed to the <i>wrong</i> Specimens, you
  know!” he said.</p>
  <p>“Oo shouldn’t have any <i>wrong</i> peppermints
  in the tray!” Bruno boldly replied. “<i>Should</i>
  he, Sylvie?”</p>
  <p>But Sylvie only shook her head.</p>
  <p>The Professor heard him not. He had taken
  up one of the bottles, and was carefully reading
  the label through his eye-glass. “Our first
  Specimen——” he announced, as he placed the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_333">333</span>
  bottle in front of the other Things, “is—that
  is, it is called——” here he took it up, and
  examined the label again, as if he thought
  it might have changed since he last saw it,
  “is called Aqua Pura—common water—the
  fluid that cheers——”</p>
  <p>“Hip! Hip! Hip!” the Head-Cook began
  enthusiastically.</p>
  <p>“—but <i>not</i> inebriates!” the Professor went
  on quickly, but only just in time to check
  the “Hooroar!” which was beginning.</p>
  <p>“Our second Specimen,” he went on, carefully
  opening a small jar, “is——” here he
  removed the lid, and a large beetle instantly
  darted out, and with an angry buzz went
  straight out of the Pavilion, “—is—or rather,
  I should say,” looking sadly into the empty
  jar, “it <i>was</i>—a curious kind of Blue Beetle.
  Did any one happen to remark—as it went
  past—three blue spots under each wing?”</p>
  <p>Nobody had remarked them.</p>
  <p>“Ah, well!” the Professor said with a sigh.
  “It’s a pity. Unless you remark that kind of
  thing <i>at the moment</i>, it’s very apt to get overlooked!
  The <i>next</i> Specimen, at any rate, will
  <span class="pb" id="Page_334">334</span>
  not fly away! It is—in short, or perhaps,
  more correctly, at <i>length</i>—an <i>Elephant</i>. You
  will observe——.” Here he beckoned to the
  Gardener to come up on the platform, and with
  his help began putting together what looked
  like an enormous dog-kennel, with short tubes
  projecting out of it on both sides.</p>
  <p>“But we’ve seen <i>Elephants</i> before,” the
  Emperor grumbled.</p>
  <p>“Yes, but not through a <i>Megaloscope</i>!” the
  Professor eagerly replied. “You know you
  can’t see a <i>Flea</i>, properly, without a <i>magnifying</i>-glass—what
  we call a <i>Microscope</i>. Well,
  just in the same way, you ca’n’t see an <i>Elephant</i>,
  properly, without a <i>minimifying</i>-glass.
  There’s one in each of these little tubes. And
  <i>this</i> is a <i>Megaloscope</i>! The Gardener will
  now bring in the next Specimen. Please open
  <i>both</i> curtains, down at the end there, and make
  way for the Elephant!”</p>
  <p>There was a general rush to the sides of the
  Pavilion, and all eyes were turned to the open
  end, watching for the return of the Gardener,
  who had gone away singing “<i>He thought he
  saw an Elephant That practised on a Fife!</i>”
  <span class="pb" id="Page_335">335</span>
  There was silence for a minute: and then his
  harsh voice was heard again in the distance.
  “<i>He looked again</i>—come up, then! <i>He looked
  again, and found it was</i>—woa back! <i>and,
  found it was A letter from his</i>—make way
  there! He’s a-coming!”</p>
  <div class="img" id="fig31">
  <img alt="‘HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT’" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i335.jpg" id="id-3499309861412296100" width="500" height="409">
  <p class="center small">‘HE THOUGHT HE SAW AN ELEPHANT’</p>
  </div>
  <p>And in marched, or waddled—it is hard to
  say which is the right word—an Elephant, on
  its hind-legs, and playing on an enormous fife
  which it held with its fore-feet.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_336">336</div>
  <p>The Professor hastily threw open a large
  door at the end of the Megaloscope, and the
  huge animal, at a signal from the Gardener,
  dropped the fife, and obediently trotted into
  the machine, the door of which was at once
  shut by the Professor. “The Specimen is
  now ready for observation!” he proclaimed.
  “It is exactly the size of the Common Mouse—<i>Mus
  Communis</i>!”</p>
  <p>There was a general rush to the tubes,
  and the spectators watched with delight the
  minikin creature, as it playfully coiled its trunk
  round the Professor’s extended finger, finally
  taking its stand upon the palm of his hand,
  while he carefully lifted it out, and carried it off
  to exhibit to the Imperial party.</p>
  <p>“Isn’t it a <i>darling</i>?” cried Bruno. “May I
  stroke it, please? I’ll touch it <i>welly</i> gently!”</p>
  <p>The Empress inspected it solemnly with her
  eye-glass. “It is very small,” she said in a
  deep voice. “Smaller than elephants usually
  are, I believe?”</p>
  <p>The Professor gave a start of delighted
  surprise. “Why, that’s <i>true</i>!” he murmured to
  himself. Then louder, turning to the audience,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_337">337</span>
  “Her Imperial Highness has made a remark
  which is perfectly sensible!” And a wild cheer
  arose from that vast multitude.</p>
  <p>“The next Specimen,” the Professor proclaimed,
  after carefully placing the little Elephant
  in the tray, among the Crystals and
  other Things, “is a <i>Flea</i>, which we will enlarge
  for the purposes of observation.” Taking a
  small pill-box from the tray, he advanced to
  the Megaloscope, and reversed all the tubes.
  “The Specimen is ready!” he cried, with his
  eye at one of the tubes, while he carefully
  emptied the pill-box through a little hole at the
  side. “It is now the size of the Common
  Horse—<i>Equus Communis</i>!”</p>
  <p>There was another general rush, to look
  through the tubes, and the Pavilion rang with
  shouts of delight, through which the Professor’s
  anxious tones could scarcely be heard. “Keep
  the door of the Microscope <i>shut</i>!” he cried.
  “If the creature were to escape, <i>this size</i>, it
  would——” But the mischief was done. The
  door had swung open, and in another moment
  the Monster had got out, and was trampling
  down the terrified, shrieking spectators.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_338">338</div>
  <p>But the Professor’s presence of mind did not
  desert him. “Undraw those curtains!” he
  shouted. It was done. The Monster gathered
  its legs together, and in one tremendous bound
  vanished into the sky.</p>
  <p>“Where <i>is</i> it?” said the Emperor, rubbing
  his eyes.</p>
  <p>“In the next Province, I fancy,” the Professor
  replied. “That jump would take it at
  <i>least</i> five miles! The next thing is to explain
  a Process or two. But I find there is
  hardly room enough to operate—the smaller
  animal is rather in my way——”</p>
  <p>“Who does he mean?” Bruno whispered
  to Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“He means <i>you</i>!” Sylvie whispered back.
  “Hush!”</p>
  <p>“Be kind enough to move—angularly—to
  <i>this</i> corner,” the Professor said, addressing
  himself to Bruno.</p>
  <p>Bruno hastily moved his chair in the direction
  indicated. “Did I move angrily enough?”
  he inquired. But the Professor was once more
  absorbed in his Lecture, which he was reading
  from his note-book.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_339">339</div>
  <p>“I will now explain the Process of—the
  name is blotted, I’m sorry to say. It will
  be illustrated by a number of—of——” here
  he examined the page for some time, and
  at last said “It seems to be either ‘Experiments’
  or ‘Specimens’——”</p>
  <p>“Let it be <i>Experiments</i>,” said the Emperor.
  “We’ve seen plenty of <i>Specimens</i>.”</p>
  <p>“Certainly, certainly!” the Professor assented.
  “We will have some Experiments.”</p>
  <p>“May <i>I</i> do them?” Bruno eagerly asked.</p>
  <p>“Oh dear no!” The Professor looked dismayed.
  “I really don’t know what would
  happen if <i>you</i> did them!”</p>
  <p>“Nor nobody doosn’t know what’ll happen
  if <i>oo</i> doos them!” Bruno retorted.</p>
  <p>“Our First Experiment requires a Machine.
  It has two knobs—only <i>two</i>—you can count
  them, if you like.”</p>
  <p>The Head-Cook stepped forwards, counted
  them, and retired satisfied.</p>
  <p>“Now you <i>might</i> press those two knobs together—but
  that’s not the way to do it. Or
  you <i>might</i> turn the Machine upside-down—but
  <i>that’s</i> not the way to do it!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_340">340</div>
  <p>“What <i>are</i> the way to do it?” said Bruno,
  who was listening very attentively.</p>
  <p>The Professor smiled benignantly. “Ah,
  yes!” he said, in a voice like the heading of a
  chapter. “The Way To Do It! Permit me!”
  and in a moment he had whisked Bruno upon
  the table. “I divide my subject,” he began,
  “into three parts——”</p>
  <p>“I think I’ll get down!” Bruno whispered to
  Sylvie. “It aren’t nice to be divided!”</p>
  <p>“He hasn’t got a knife, silly boy!” Sylvie
  whispered in reply. “Stand still! You’ll break
  all the bottles!”</p>
  <p>“The first part is to take hold of the knobs,”
  putting them into Bruno’s hands. “The second
  part is——” Here he turned the handle, and,
  with a loud “Oh!”, Bruno dropped both the
  knobs, and began rubbing his elbows.</p>
  <p>The Professor chuckled in delight. “It had
  a sensible effect. <i>Hadn’t</i> it?” he enquired.</p>
  <p>“No, it hadn’t a <i>sensible</i> effect!” Bruno said
  indignantly. “It were very silly indeed. It
  jingled my elbows, and it banged my back,
  and it crinkled my hair, and it buzzed among
  my bones!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_341">341</div>
  <p>“I’m sure it <i>didn’t</i>!” said Sylvie. “You’re
  only inventing!”</p>
  <p>“Oo doosn’t know nuffin about it!” Bruno
  replied. “Oo wasn’t there to see. Nobody
  ca’n’t go among my bones. There isn’t room!”</p>
  <p>“Our Second Experiment,” the Professor
  announced, as Bruno returned to his place, still
  thoughtfully rubbing his elbows, “is the production
  of that seldom-seen-but-greatly-to-be-admired
  phenomenon, Black Light! You have
  seen White Light, Red Light, Green Light, and
  so on: but never, till this wonderful day, have
  any eyes but mine seen <i>Black Light</i>! This
  box,” carefully lifting it upon the table, and
  covering it with a heap of blankets, “is quite
  full of it. The way I made it was this—I
  took a lighted candle into a dark cupboard and
  shut the door. Of course the cupboard was
  then full of <i>Yellow</i> Light. Then I took a bottle
  of Black ink, and poured it over the candle:
  and, to my delight, every atom of the Yellow
  Light turned <i>Black</i>! That was indeed the
  proudest moment of my life! Then I filled a
  box with it. And now—would any one like
  to get under the blankets and see it?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_342">342</div>
  <p>Dead silence followed this appeal: but at last
  Bruno said “<i>I’ll</i> get under, if it won’t jingle
  my elbows.”</p>
  <p>Satisfied on this point, Bruno crawled under
  the blankets, and, after a minute or two, crawled
  out again, very hot and dusty, and with his hair
  in the wildest confusion.</p>
  <p>“What did you see in the box?” Sylvie
  eagerly enquired.</p>
  <p>“I saw <i>nuffin</i>!” Bruno sadly replied. “It
  were too dark!”</p>
  <p>“He has described the appearance of the
  thing exactly!” the Professor exclaimed with
  enthusiasm. “Black Light, and Nothing, look
  so extremely alike, at first sight, that I don’t
  wonder he failed to distinguish them! We will
  now proceed to the Third Experiment.”</p>
  <p>The Professor came down, and led the way
  to where a post had been driven firmly into
  the ground. To one side of the post was
  fastened a chain, with an iron weight hooked
  on to the end of it, and from the other side
  projected a piece of whalebone, with a ring
  at the end of it. “This is a <i>most</i> interesting
  Experiment!” the Professor announced. “It
  <span class="pb" id="Page_343">343</span>
  will need <i>time</i>, I’m afraid: but that is a trifling
  disadvantage. Now observe. If I were to unhook
  this weight, and let go, it would fall to the
  ground. You do not deny <i>that</i>?”</p>
  <p>Nobody denied it.</p>
  <p>“And in the same way, if I were to bend
  this piece of whalebone round the post—thus—and
  put the ring over this hook—thus—it
  stays bent: but, if I unhook it, it straightens
  itself again. You do not deny <i>that</i>?”</p>
  <p>Again, nobody denied it.</p>
  <p>“Well, now, suppose we left things just as
  they are, for a long time. The force of the
  <i>whalebone</i> would get exhausted, you know, and
  it would stay bent, even when you unhooked it.
  Now, <i>why</i> shouldn’t the same thing happen
  with the <i>weight</i>? The <i>whalebone</i> gets so
  used to being bent, that it ca’n’t <i>straighten</i>
  itself any more. Why shouldn’t the <i>weight</i>
  get so used to being held up, that it ca’n’t <i>fall</i>
  any more? That’s what <i>I</i> want to know!”</p>
  <p>“That’s what <i>we</i> want to know!” echoed
  the crowd.</p>
  <p>“How long must we wait?” grumbled the
  Emperor.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_344">344</div>
  <p>The Professor looked at his watch. “Well,
  I <i>think</i> a thousand years will do to <i>begin</i> with,”
  he said. “Then we will cautiously unhook
  the weight: and, if it <i>still</i> shows (as perhaps
  it will) a <i>slight</i> tendency to fall, we will hook
  it on to the chain again, and leave it for
  <i>another</i> thousand years.”</p>
  <p>Here the Empress experienced one of those
  flashes of Common Sense which were the surprise
  of all around her. “Meanwhile there’ll
  be time for another Experiment,” she said.</p>
  <p>“There will <i>indeed</i>!” cried the delighted
  Professor. “Let us return to the platform, and
  proceed to the <i>Fourth</i> Experiment!”</p>
  <p>“For this concluding Experiment, I will take
  a certain Alkali, or Acid—I forget which.
  Now you’ll see what will happen when I mix
  it with Some——” here he took up a bottle,
  and looked at it doubtfully, “—when I mix
  it with—with Something——”</p>
  <p>Here the Emperor interrupted. “What’s the
  <i>name</i> of the stuff?” he asked.</p>
  <p>“I don’t remember the <i>name</i>,” said the Professor:
  “and the label has come off.” He
  emptied it quickly into the other bottle, and,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_345">345</span>
  with a tremendous bang, both bottles flew to
  pieces, upsetting all the machines, and filling
  the Pavilion with thick black smoke. I sprang
  to my feet in terror, and—and found myself
  standing before my solitary hearth, where the
  poker, dropping at last from the hand of the
  sleeper, had knocked over the tongs and the
  shovel, and had upset the kettle, filling the air
  with clouds of steam. With a weary sigh, I
  betook myself to bed.</p>

  <br><span class="small">THE BANQUET.</span></h2>
  <p>“<i>Heaviness may endure for a night: but joy
  cometh in the morning.</i>” The next day found
  me quite another being. Even the memories of
  my lost friend and companion were sunny as
  the genial weather that smiled around me. I
  did not venture to trouble Lady Muriel, or her
  father, with another call so soon: but took a
  walk into the country, and only turned homewards
  when the low sunbeams warned me that
  day would soon be over.</p>
  <p>On my way home, I passed the cottage where
  the old man lived, whose face always recalled
  <span class="pb" id="Page_347">347</span>
  to me the day when I first met Lady Muriel;
  and I glanced in as I passed, half-curious to see
  if he were still living there.</p>
  <p>Yes: the old man was still alive. He was
  sitting out in the porch, looking just as he did
  when I first saw him at Fayfield Junction—it
  seemed only a few days ago!</p>
  <p>“Good evening!” I said, pausing.</p>
  <p>“Good evening, Maister!” he cheerfully
  responded. “Wo’n’t ee step in?”</p>
  <p>I stepped in, and took a seat on the bench
  in the porch. “I’m glad to see you looking
  so hearty,” I began. “Last time, I remember,
  I chanced to pass just as Lady Muriel was
  coming away from the house. Does she still
  come to see you?”</p>
  <p>“Ees,” he answered slowly. “She has na
  forgotten me. I don’t lose her bonny face for
  many days together. Well I mind the very
  first time she come, after we’d met at Railway
  Station. She told me as she come to mak’
  amends. Dear child! Only think o’ that!
  To mak’ amends!”</p>
  <p>“To make amends for what?” I enquired.
  “What could <i>she</i> have done to need it?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_348">348</div>
  <p>“Well, it were loike this, you see? We were
  both on us a-waiting fur t’ train at t’ Junction.
  And I had setten mysen down upat t’ bench.
  And Station-Maister, <i>he</i> comes and he orders
  me off—fur t’ mak’ room for her Ladyship,
  you understand?”</p>
  <p>“I remember it all,” I said. “I was there
  myself, that day.”</p>
  <p>“<i>Was</i> you, now? Well, an’ she axes my
  pardon fur’t. Think o’ that, now! <i>My</i> pardon!
  An owd ne’er-do-weel like me! Ah! She’s
  been here many a time, sin’ then. Why, she
  were in here only yestere’en, as it were, asittin’,
  as it might be, where you’re a-sitting
  now, an’ lookin’ sweeter and kinder nor an
  angel! An’ she says ‘You’ve not got your
  Minnie, now,’ she says, ‘to fettle for ye.’
  Minnie was my grand-daughter, Sir, as lived
  wi’ me. She died, a matter of two months
  ago—or it may be three. She was a bonny
  lass—and a good lass, too. Eh, but life has
  been rare an’ lonely without her!”</p>
  <p>He covered his face in his hands: and I
  waited a minute or two, in silence, for him to
  recover himself.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_349">349</div>
  <p>“So she says ‘Just tak’ <i>me</i> fur your Minnie!’
  she says. ‘Didna Minnie mak’ your tea fur
  you?’ says she. ‘Ay,’ says I. An she mak’s
  the tea. ‘An’ didna Minnie light your pipe?’
  says she. ‘Ay,’ says I. An’ she lights the
  pipe for me. ‘An’ didna Minnie set out your
  tea in t’ porch?’ An’ I says ‘My dear,’ I
  says, ‘I’m thinking you’re Minnie hersen!’
  An’ she cries a bit. We both on us cries a
  bit——.”</p>
  <p>Again I kept silence for a while.</p>
  <p>“An’ while I smokes my pipe, she sits an’
  talks to me—as loving an’ as pleasant! I’ll
  be bound I thowt it were Minnie come again!
  An’ when she gets up to go, I says ‘Winnot ye
  shak’ hands wi’ me?’ says I. An’ she says
  ‘Na,’ she says: ‘a cannot <i>shak’ hands</i> wi’
  thee!’ she says.”</p>
  <p>“I’m sorry she said <i>that</i>,” I put in, thinking
  it was the only instance I had ever known of
  pride of rank showing itself in Lady Muriel.</p>
  <p>“Bless you, it werena <i>pride</i>!” said the
  old man, reading my thoughts. “She says
  ‘<i>Your</i> Minnie never <i>shook hands</i> wi’ you!’ she
  says. ‘An’ <i>I’m</i> your Minnie now,’ she says.
  <span class="pb" id="Page_350">350</span>
  An’ she just puts her dear arms about my
  neck—and she kisses me on t’ cheek—an’
  may God in Heaven bless her!” And here
  the poor old man broke down entirely, and
  could say no more.</p>
  <div class="img" id="fig33">
  <img alt="‘A CANNOT SHAK’ HANDS WI’ THEE!’" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i350.jpg" id="id-9145416767985595036" width="500" height="708">
  <p class="center small">‘A CANNOT SHAK’ HANDS WI’ THEE!’</p>
  </div>
  <p>“God bless her!” I echoed. “And good
  night to you!” I pressed his hand, and left
  <span class="pb" id="Page_351">351</span>
  him. “Lady Muriel,” I said softly to myself
  as I went homewards, “truly you know how
  to ‘mak’ amends’!”</p>
  <p>Seated once more by my lonely fireside, I
  tried to recall the strange vision of the night
  before, and to conjure up the face of the dear
  old Professor among the blazing coals. “That
  black one—with just a touch of red—would
  suit him well,” I thought. “After such a catastrophe,
  it would be sure to be covered with
  black stains—and he would say:—</p>
  <p>“The result of <i>that</i> combination—you may
  have noticed?—was an <i>Explosion</i>! Shall I
  repeat the Experiment?”</p>
  <p>“No, no! Don’t trouble yourself!” was the
  general cry. And we all trooped off, in hot
  haste, to the Banqueting-Hall, where the feast
  had already begun.</p>
  <p>No time was lost in helping the dishes, and
  very speedily every guest found his plate filled
  with good things.</p>
  <p>“I have always maintained the principle,”
  the Professor began, “that it is a good rule
  to take some food—occasionally. The great
  advantage of dinner-parties——” he broke off
  suddenly. “Why, actually here’s the Other
  Professor!” he cried. “And there’s no place
  left for him!”</p>

  <img alt="THE OTHER PROFESSOR’S FALL" src="Sylvie%20and%20Bruno,%20Volume%20II,%20by%20Lewis%20Carroll,%20illustrated%20by%20Harry%20Furniss_files/i352.jpg" id="id-8626867572220544855" width="758" height="500">
  <p class="center small">THE OTHER PROFESSOR’S FALL</p>
  </div>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_353">353</div>
  <p>The Other Professor came in reading a large
  book, which he held close to his eyes. One
  result of his not looking where he was going
  was that he tripped up, as he crossed the
  Saloon, flew up into the air, and fell heavily
  on his face in the middle of the table.</p>
  <p>“<i>What</i> a pity!” cried the kind-hearted Professor,
  as he helped him up.</p>
  <p>“It wouldn’t be <i>me</i>, if I didn’t trip,” said the
  Other Professor.</p>
  <p>The Professor looked much shocked. “Almost
  <i>anything</i> would be better than <i>that</i>!” he
  exclaimed. “It never does,” he added, aside
  to Bruno, “to be anybody else, does it?”</p>
  <p>To which Bruno gravely replied “I’s got
  nuffin on my plate.”</p>
  <p>The Professor hastily put on his spectacles,
  to make sure that the <i>facts</i> were all right, to
  begin with: then he turned his jolly round
  face upon the unfortunate owner of the empty
  plate. “And what would you like next,
  my little man?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_354">354</div>
  <p>“Well,” Bruno said, a little doubtfully, “I
  think I’ll take some plum-pudding, please—while
  I think of it.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, Bruno!” (This was a whisper from
  Sylvie.) “It isn’t good manners to ask for a
  dish before it comes!”</p>
  <p>And Bruno whispered back “But I might forget
  to ask for some, when it comes, oo know—I
  <i>do</i> forget things, sometimes,” he added,
  seeing Sylvie about to whisper more.</p>
  <p>And <i>this</i> assertion Sylvie did not venture to
  contradict.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile a chair had been placed for the
  Other Professor, between the Empress and
  Sylvie. Sylvie found him a rather uninteresting
  neighbour: in fact, she couldn’t afterwards
  remember that he had made more than <i>one</i>
  remark to her during the whole banquet, and
  that was “What a comfort a Dictionary is!”
  (She told Bruno, afterwards, that she had been
  too much afraid of him to say more than “Yes,
  Sir,” in reply; and that had been the end of
  their conversation. On which Bruno expressed
  a very decided opinion that <i>that</i> wasn’t worth
  calling a ‘conversation’ at all. “Oo should
  <span class="pb" id="Page_355">355</span>
  have asked him a riddle!” he added triumphantly.
  “Why, <i>I</i> asked the Professor <i>three</i>
  riddles! One was that one you asked me in
  the morning, ‘How many pennies is there in
  two shillings?’ And another was——” “Oh,
  Bruno!” Sylvie interrupted. “<i>That</i> wasn’t a
  riddle!” “It <i>were</i>!” Bruno fiercely replied.)</p>
  <p>By this time a waiter had supplied Bruno
  with a plateful of <i>something</i>, which drove the
  plum-pudding out of his head.</p>
  <p>“Another advantage of dinner-parties,” the
  Professor cheerfully explained, for the benefit
  of any one that would listen, “is that it helps
  you to <i>see</i> your friends. If you want to <i>see</i> a
  man, offer him something to eat. It’s the same
  rule with a mouse.”</p>
  <p>“This Cat’s very kind to the Mouses,” Bruno
  said, stooping to stroke a remarkably fat specimen
  of the race, that had just waddled into the
  room, and was rubbing itself affectionately
  against the leg of his chair. “Please, Sylvie,
  pour some milk in your saucer. Pussie’s ever
  so thirsty!”</p>
  <p>“Why do you want <i>my</i> saucer?” said Sylvie.
  “You’ve got one yourself!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_356">356</div>
  <p>“Yes, I know,” said Bruno: “but I wanted
  <i>mine</i> for to give it some <i>more</i> milk in.”</p>
  <p>Sylvie looked unconvinced: however it
  seemed quite impossible for her <i>ever</i> to refuse
  what her brother asked: so she quietly filled
  her saucer with milk, and handed it to Bruno,
  who got down off his chair to administer it to
  the cat.</p>
  <p>“The room’s very hot, with all this crowd,”
  the Professor said to Sylvie. “I wonder why
  they don’t put some lumps of ice in the grate?
  You fill it with lumps of coal in the winter, you
  know, and you sit round it and enjoy the
  warmth. How jolly it would be to fill it now
  with lumps of ice, and sit round it and enjoy
  the coolth!”</p>
  <p>Hot as it was, Sylvie shivered a little at the
  idea. “It’s very cold <i>outside</i>,” she said. “My
  feet got almost frozen to-day.”</p>
  <p>“That’s the <i>shoemaker’s</i> fault!” the Professor
  cheerfully replied. “How often I’ve
  explained to him that he <i>ought</i> to make boots
  with little iron frames under the soles, to hold
  lamps! But he never <i>thinks</i>. No one would
  suffer from cold, if only they would <i>think</i> of
  <span class="pb" id="Page_357">357</span>
  those little things. I always use hot ink, myself,
  in the winter. Very few people ever think
  of <i>that</i>! Yet how simple it is!”</p>
  <p>“Yes, it’s very simple,” Sylvie said politely.
  “Has the cat had enough?” This was to
  Bruno, who had brought back the saucer only
  half-emptied.</p>
  <p>But Bruno did not hear the question.
  “There’s somebody scratching at the door
  and wanting to come in,” he said. And he
  scrambled down off his chair, and went and
  cautiously peeped out through the door-way.</p>
  <p>“Who was it wanted to come in?” Sylvie
  asked, as he returned to his place.</p>
  <p>“It were a Mouse,” said Bruno. “And it
  peepted in. And it saw the Cat. And it said
  ‘I’ll come in another day.’ And I said ‘Oo
  needn’t be flightened. The Cat’s <i>welly</i> kind
  to Mouses.’ And it said ‘But I’s got some
  imporkant business, what I <i>must</i> attend to.’
  And it said ‘I’ll call again to-morrow.’ And it
  said ‘Give my love to the Cat.’”</p>
  <p>“What a fat cat it is!” said the Lord Chancellor,
  leaning across the Professor to address
  his small neighbour. “It’s quite a wonder!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_358">358</div>
  <p>“It was awfully fat when it camed in,” said
  Bruno: “so it would be more wonderfuller if
  it got thin all in a minute.”</p>
  <p>“And that was the reason, I suppose,” the
  Lord Chancellor suggested, “why you didn’t
  give it the rest of the milk?”</p>
  <p>“No,” said Bruno. “It were a betterer
  reason. I tooked the saucer up ’cause it were
  so discontented!”</p>
  <p>“It doesn’t look so to <i>me</i>,” said the Lord
  Chancellor. “What made you think it was
  discontented?”</p>
  <p>“’Cause it grumbled in its throat.”</p>
  <p>“Oh, Bruno!” cried Sylvie. “Why, that’s
  the way cats show they’re <i>pleased</i>!”</p>
  <p>Bruno looked doubtful. “It’s not a good
  way,” he objected. “Oo wouldn’t say <i>I</i> were
  pleased, if I made that noise in my throat!”</p>
  <p>“What a singular boy!” the Lord Chancellor
  whispered to himself: but Bruno had
  caught the words.</p>
  <p>“What do it mean to say ‘a <i>singular</i> boy’?”
  he whispered to Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“It means <i>one</i> boy,” Sylvie whispered in
  return. “And <i>plural</i> means two or three.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_359">359</div>
  <p>“Then I’s welly glad I <i>is</i> a singular boy!”
  Bruno said with great emphasis. “It would be
  <i>horrid</i> to be two or three boys! P’raps they
  wouldn’t play with me!”</p>
  <p>“Why <i>should</i> they?” said the Other Professor,
  suddenly waking up out of a deep
  reverie. “They might be asleep, you know.”</p>
  <p>“Couldn’t, if <i>I</i> was awake,” Bruno said
  cunningly.</p>
  <p>“Oh, but they might indeed!” the Other
  Professor protested. “Boys don’t all go to
  sleep at once, you know. So these boys—but
  who are you talking about?”</p>
  <p>“He <i>never</i> remembers to ask that first!” the
  Professor whispered to the children.</p>
  <p>“Why, the rest of <i>me</i>, a-course!” Bruno
  exclaimed triumphantly. “Supposing I was
  two or three boys!”</p>
  <p>The Other Professor sighed, and seemed to
  be sinking back into his reverie; but suddenly
  brightened up again, and addressed the Professor.
  “There’s nothing more to be done
  <i>now</i>, is there?”</p>
  <p>“Well, there’s the dinner to finish,” the Professor
  said with a bewildered smile: “and the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_360">360</span>
  heat to bear. I hope you’ll enjoy the dinner—such
  as it is; and that you won’t mind the
  heat—such as it isn’t.”</p>
  <p>The sentence <i>sounded</i> well, but somehow I
  couldn’t quite understand it; and the Other
  Professor seemed to be no better off. “Such
  as it isn’t <i>what</i>?” he peevishly enquired.</p>
  <p>“It isn’t as hot as it might be,” the Professor
  replied, catching at the first idea that
  came to hand.</p>
  <p>“Ah, I see what you mean <i>now</i>!” the Other
  Professor graciously remarked. “It’s very
  badly expressed, but I quite see it <i>now</i>! Thirteen
  minutes and a half ago,” he went on,
  looking first at Bruno and then at his watch
  as he spoke, “you said ‘this Cat’s very kind to
  the Mouses.’ It must be a singular animal!”</p>
  <p>“So it <i>are</i>,” said Bruno, after carefully examining
  the Cat, to make sure how many there
  were of it.</p>
  <p>“But how do you know it’s kind to the
  Mouses—or, more correctly speaking, the
  <i>Mice</i>?”</p>
  <p>“’Cause it <i>plays</i> with the Mouses,” said Bruno;
  “for to amuse them, oo know.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_361">361</div>
  <p>“But that is just what I <i>don’t</i> know,” the
  Other Professor rejoined. “My belief is, it
  plays with them to <i>kill</i> them!”</p>
  <p>“Oh, that’s quite a <i>accident</i>!” Bruno began,
  so eagerly, that it was evident he had already
  propounded this very difficulty to the Cat.
  “It ’splained all that to me, while it were
  drinking the milk. It said ‘I teaches the
  Mouses new games: the Mouses likes it ever
  so much.’ It said ‘Sometimes little accidents
  happens: sometimes the Mouses kills theirselves.’
  It said ‘I’s always <i>welly</i> sorry, when
  the Mouses kills theirselves.’ It said——”</p>
  <p>“If it was so <i>very</i> sorry,” Sylvie said, rather
  disdainfully, “it wouldn’t <i>eat</i> the Mouses after
  they’d killed themselves!”</p>
  <p>But this difficulty, also, had evidently not
  been lost sight of in the exhaustive ethical discussion
  just concluded. “It said——” (the
  orator constantly omitted, as superfluous, his
  own share in the dialogue, and merely gave us
  the replies of the Cat) “It said ‘Dead Mouses
  <i>never</i> objecks to be eaten.’ It said ‘There’s no
  use wasting good Mouses.’ It said ‘Wifful—’
  sumfinoruvver. It said ‘And oo may live to
  <span class="pb" id="Page_362">362</span>
  say ‘How much I wiss I had the Mouse that
  then I frew away!’ It said——.”</p>
  <p>“It hadn’t <i>time</i> to say such a lot of things!”
  Sylvie interrupted indignantly.</p>
  <p>“Oo doosn’t know how Cats speaks!” Bruno
  rejoined contemptuously. “Cats speaks <i>welly</i>
  quick!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_363">363</div>
  <h2 id="c23">CHAPTER XXIII.
  <br><span class="small">THE PIG-TALE.</span></h2>
  <p>By this time the appetites of the guests
  seemed to be nearly satisfied, and even <i>Bruno</i>
  had the resolution to say, when the Professor
  offered him a fourth slice of plum-pudding,
  “I thinks three helpings is enough!”</p>
  <p>Suddenly the Professor started as if he had
  been electrified. “Why, I had nearly forgotten
  the most important part of the entertainment!
  The Other Professor is to recite a
  Tale of a Pig—I mean a Pig-Tale,” he corrected
  himself. “It has Introductory Verses
  at the beginning, and at the end.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_364">364</div>
  <p>“It ca’n’t have Introductory Verses at the
  <i>end</i>, can it?” said Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“Wait till you hear it,” said the Professor:
  “then you’ll see. I’m not sure it hasn’t some
  in the <i>middle</i>, as well.” Here he rose to his
  feet, and there was an instant silence through
  the Banqueting-Hall: they evidently expected
  a speech.</p>
  <p>“Ladies, and gentlemen,” the Professor
  began, “the Other Professor is so kind as to
  recite a Poem. The title of it is ‘The Pig-Tale.’
  He never recited it before!” (General
  cheering among the guests.) “He will never
  recite it again!” (Frantic excitement, and wild
  cheering all down the hall, the Professor himself
  mounting the table in hot haste, to lead the
  cheering, and waving his spectacles in one hand
  and a spoon in the other.)</p>
  <p>Then the Other Professor got up, and
  began:—</p>

  <p>When the Other Professor had recited this

  put his head up the chimney. In doing this,
  he lost his balance, and fell head-first into the
  empty grate, and got so firmly fixed there
  that it was some time before he could be
  dragged out again.</p>
  <p>Bruno had had time to say “I thought he
  wanted to see how many peoples was up

  <p>And Sylvie had said “<i>Chimney</i>—not

  <p>“You must have blacked your face!” the

  keeping his face turned away. “Black’s quite
  a respectable colour. Besides, soap would be
  no use without water.”</p>
  <p>Keeping his back well turned away from
  the audience, he went on with the Introductory

  <p>“It’s a miserable story!” said Bruno. “It
  begins miserably, and it ends miserablier. I
  think I shall cry. Sylvie, please lend me your
  handkerchief.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_374">374</div>
  <p>“I haven’t got it with me,” Sylvie whispered.</p>
  <p>“Then I won’t cry,” said Bruno manfully.</p>
  <p>“There are more Introductory Verses to
  come,” said the Other Professor, “but I’m
  hungry.” He sat down, cut a large slice
  of cake, put it on Bruno’s plate, and gazed
  at his own empty plate in astonishment.</p>
  <p>“Where did you get that cake?” Sylvie
  whispered to Bruno.</p>
  <p>“He gived it me,” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“But you shouldn’t ask for things! You
  <i>know</i> you shouldn’t!”</p>
  <p>“I <i>didn’t</i> ask,” said Bruno, taking a fresh
  mouthful: “he <i>gived</i> it me.”</p>
  <p>Sylvie considered this for a moment: then
  she saw her way out of it. “Well, then, ask
  him to give <i>me</i> some!”</p>
  <p>“You seem to enjoy that cake?” the Professor
  remarked.</p>
  <p>“Doos that mean ‘munch’?” Bruno whispered
  to Sylvie.</p>
  <p>Sylvie nodded. “It means ‘to munch’ and
  ‘to <i>like</i> to munch.’”</p>
  <p>Bruno smiled at the Professor. “I <i>doos</i>
  enjoy it,” he said.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_375">375</div>
  <p>The Other Professor caught the word. “And
  I hope you’re enjoying <i>yourself</i>, little Man?”
  he enquired.</p>
  <p>Bruno’s look of horror quite startled him.
  “No, <i>indeed</i> I aren’t!” he said.</p>
  <p>The Other Professor looked thoroughly
  puzzled. “Well, well!” he said. “Try some
  cowslip wine!” And he filled a glass and
  handed it to Bruno. “Drink this, my dear,
  and you’ll be quite another man!”</p>
  <p>“Who shall I be?” said Bruno, pausing in
  the act of putting it to his lips.</p>
  <p>“Don’t ask so many questions!” Sylvie
  interposed, anxious to save the poor old man
  from further bewilderment. “Suppose we get
  the Professor to tell us a story.”</p>
  <p>Bruno adopted the idea with enthusiasm.
  “<i>Please</i> do!” he cried eagerly. “Sumfin
  about tigers—and bumble-bees—and robin-redbreasts,
  oo knows!”</p>
  <p>“Why should you always have <i>live</i> things
  in stories?” said the Professor. “Why don’t
  you have events, or circumstances?”</p>
  <p>“Oh, <i>please</i> invent a story like that!” cried
  Bruno.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_376">376</div>
  <p>The Professor began fluently enough. “Once
  a coincidence was taking a walk with a little
  accident, and they met an explanation—a <i>very</i>
  old explanation—so old that it was quite
  doubled up, and looked more like a conundrum——”
  he broke off suddenly.</p>
  <p>“<i>Please</i> go on!” both children exclaimed.</p>
  <p>The Professor made a candid confession.
  “It’s a very difficult sort to invent, I find.
  Suppose Bruno tells one, first.”</p>
  <p>Bruno was only too happy to adopt the
  suggestion.</p>
  <p>“Once there were a Pig, and a Accordion,
  and two Jars of Orange-marmalade——”</p>
  <p>“The <i>dramatis personæ</i>,” murmured the
  Professor. “Well, what then?”</p>
  <p>“So, when the Pig played on the Accordion,”
  Bruno went on, “one of the Jars of Orange-marmalade
  didn’t like the tune, and the other
  Jar of Orange-marmalade did like the tune—I
  <i>know</i> I shall get confused among those Jars
  of Orange-marmalade, Sylvie!” he whispered
  anxiously.</p>
  <p>“I will now recite the other Introductory
  Verses,” said the Other Professor.</p>

  <p>“The next thing to be done,” the Professor
  cheerfully remarked to the Lord Chancellor,
  as soon as the applause, caused by the recital
  of the Pig-Tale, had come to an end, “is to
  drink the Emperor’s health, is it not?”</p>
  <p>“Undoubtedly!” the Lord Chancellor replied
  with much solemnity, as he rose to his
  feet to give the necessary directions for the
  ceremony. “Fill your glasses!” he thundered.
  All did so, instantly. “Drink the Emperor’s
  health!” A general gurgling resounded all
  through the Hall. “Three cheers for the
  Emperor!” The faintest possible sound followed
  <i>this</i> announcement: and the Chancellor,
  with admirable presence of mind, instantly
  proclaimed “A speech from the Emperor!”</p>
  <p>The Emperor had begun his speech almost
  before the words were uttered. “However
  unwilling to be Emperor—since you all wish
  me to be Emperor—you know how badly
  the late Warden managed things—with such
  enthusiasm as you have shown—he persecuted
  you—he taxed you too heavily—you
  know who is fittest man to be Emperor—my
  brother had no sense——.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_379">379</div>
  <p>How long this curious speech might have
  lasted it is impossible to say, for just at this
  moment a hurricane shook the palace to its
  foundations, bursting open the windows, extinguishing
  some of the lamps, and filling the air
  with clouds of dust, which took strange shapes
  in the air, and seemed to form words.</p>
  <p>But the storm subsided as suddenly as it had
  risen—the casements swung into their places
  again: the dust vanished: all was as it had
  been a minute ago—with the exception of
  the Emperor and Empress, over whom had
  come a wondrous change. The vacant stare,
  the meaningless smile, had passed away: all
  could see that these two strange beings had
  returned to their senses.</p>
  <p>The Emperor continued his speech as if
  there had been no interruption. “And we have
  behaved—my wife and I—like two arrant
  Knaves. We deserve no better name. When
  my brother went away, you lost the best Warden
  you ever had. And I’ve been doing my
  best, wretched hypocrite that I am, to cheat you
  into making me an Emperor. Me! One that
  has hardly got the wits to be a shoe-black!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_380">380</div>
  <p>The Lord Chancellor wrung his hands in
  despair. “He is mad, good people!” he was
  beginning. But both speeches stopped suddenly—and,
  in the dead silence that followed,
  a knocking was heard at the outer door.</p>
  <p>“What is it?” was the general cry. People
  began running in and out. The excitement
  increased every moment. The Lord Chancellor,
  forgetting all the rules of Court-ceremony, ran
  full speed down the hall, and in a minute
  returned, pale and gasping for breath.</p>

  <br><span class="small">THE BEGGAR’S RETURN.</span></h2>
  <p>“Your Imperial Highnesses!” he began.
  “It’s the old Beggar again! Shall we set the
  dogs at him?”</p>
  <p>“Bring him here!” said the Emperor.</p>
  <p>The Chancellor could scarcely believe his
  ears. “<i>Here</i>, your Imperial Highness? Did
  I rightly understand——.”</p>
  <p>“Bring him here!” the Emperor thundered
  once more. The Chancellor tottered down
  the hall—and in another minute the crowd
  divided, and the poor old Beggar was seen
  entering the Banqueting-Hall.</p>

  <p>He was indeed a pitiable object: the rags,
  that hung about him, were all splashed with
  mud: his white hair and his long beard were
  tossed about in wild disorder. Yet he walked
  upright, with a stately tread, as if used to command:
  and—strangest sight of all—Sylvie
  and Bruno came with him, clinging to his hands,
  and gazing at him with looks of silent love.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_383">383</div>
  <p>Men looked eagerly to see how the Emperor
  would receive the bold intruder. Would
  he hurl him from the steps of the daïs? But
  no. To their utter astonishment, the Emperor
  knelt as the beggar approached, and with
  bowed head murmured “Forgive us!”</p>
  <p>“Forgive us!” the Empress, kneeling at her
  husband’s side, meekly repeated.</p>
  <p>The Outcast smiled. “Rise up!” he said.
  “I forgive you!” And men saw with wonder
  that a change had passed over the old beggar,
  even as he spoke. What had seemed, but now,
  to be vile rags and splashes of mud, were seen
  to be in truth kingly trappings, broidered with
  gold, and sparkling with gems. All knew him
  now, and bent low before the Elder Brother, the
  true Warden.</p>
  <p>“Brother mine, and Sister mine!” the Warden
  began, in a clear voice that was heard all
  through that vast hall. “I come not to disturb
  you. Rule on, as Emperor, and rule wisely.
  For I am chosen King of Elfland. To-morrow
  I return there, taking nought from hence, save
  only—save only——” his voice trembled, and
  with a look of ineffable tenderness, he laid
  <span class="pb" id="Page_384">384</span>
  his hands in silence on the heads of the two
  little ones who clung around him.</p>
  <p>But he recovered himself in a moment, and
  beckoned to the Emperor to resume his place
  at the table. The company seated themselves
  again—room being found for the Elfin-King
  between his two children—and the Lord
  Chancellor rose once more, to propose the
  next toast.</p>
  <p>“The next toast—the hero of the day—why,
  he isn’t here!” he broke off in wild
  confusion.</p>
  <p>Good gracious! Everybody had forgotten
  Prince Uggug!</p>
  <p>“He was told of the Banquet, of course?”
  said the Emperor.</p>
  <p>“Undoubtedly!” replied the Chancellor.
  “<i>That</i> would be the duty of the Gold Stick
  in Waiting.”</p>
  <p>“Let the Gold Stick come forwards!” the
  Emperor gravely said.</p>
  <p>The Gold Stick came forwards. “I attended
  on His Imperial Fatness,” was the statement
  made by the trembling official. “I told him
  of the Lecture and the Banquet——.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_385">385</div>
  <p>“What followed?” said the Emperor: for
  the unhappy man seemed almost too frightened
  to go on.</p>
  <p>“His Imperial Fatness was graciously pleased
  to be sulky. His Imperial Fatness was graciously
  pleased to box my ears. His Imperial
  Fatness was graciously pleased to say ‘I don’t
  care!’”</p>
  <p>“‘Don’t-care’ came to a bad end,” Sylvie
  whispered to Bruno. “I’m not sure, but I
  <i>believe</i> he was hanged.”</p>
  <p>The Professor overheard her. “<i>That</i> result,”
  he blandly remarked, “was merely a case of
  mistaken identity.”</p>
  <p>Both children looked puzzled.</p>
  <p>“Permit me to explain. ‘Don’t-care’ and
  ‘Care’ were twin-brothers. ‘Care,’ you know,
  killed the Cat. And they caught ‘Don’t-care’
  by mistake, and hanged him instead. And so
  ‘Care’ is alive still. But he’s very unhappy
  without his brother. That’s why they say
  ‘Begone, dull Care!’”</p>
  <p>“Thank you!” Sylvie said, heartily. “It’s
  very extremely interesting. Why, it seems to
  explain <i>everything</i>!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_386">386</div>
  <p>“Well, not quite <i>everything</i>,” the Professor
  modestly rejoined. “There are two or three
  scientific difficulties——”</p>
  <p>“What was your general impression as to
  His Imperial Fatness?” the Emperor asked
  the Gold Stick.</p>
  <p>“My impression was that His Imperial Fatness
  was getting more——”</p>
  <p>“More <i>what</i>?”</p>
  <p>All listened breathlessly for the next word.</p>
  <p>“More <span class="small">PRICKLY</span>!”</p>
  <p>“He must be sent for <i>at once</i>!” the Emperor
  exclaimed. And the Gold Stick went off
  like a shot. The Elfin-King sadly shook his
  head. “No use, no use!” he murmured to
  himself. “Loveless, loveless!”</p>
  <p>Pale, trembling, speechless, the Gold Stick
  came slowly back again.</p>
  <p>“Well?” said the Emperor. “Why does
  not the Prince appear?”</p>
  <p>“One can easily guess,” said the Professor.
  “His Imperial Fatness is, without doubt, a
  little preoccupied.”</p>
  <p>Bruno turned a look of solemn enquiry on
  his old friend. “What do that word mean?”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_387">387</div>
  <p>But the Professor took no notice of the question.
  He was eagerly listening to the Gold
  Stick’s reply.</p>
  <p>“Please your Highness! His Imperial Fatness
  is——” Not a word more could he utter.</p>
  <p>The Empress rose in an agony of alarm.
  “Let us go to him!” she cried. And there
  was a general rush for the door.</p>
  <p>Bruno slipped off his chair in a moment.
  “May we go too?” he eagerly asked. But
  the King did not hear the question, as the
  Professor was speaking to him. “<i>Preoccupied</i>,
  your Majesty!” he was saying. “That is
  what he is, no doubt!”</p>
  <p>“May we go and see him?” Bruno repeated.
  The King nodded assent, and the children ran
  off. In a minute or two they returned, slowly
  and gravely. “Well?” said the King. “What’s
  the matter with the Prince?”</p>
  <p>“He’s—what <i>you</i> said,” Bruno replied,
  looking at the Professor. “That hard word.”
  And he looked to Sylvie for assistance.</p>
  <p>“Porcupine,” said Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“No, no!” the Professor corrected her.
  “‘<i>Pre-occupied</i>,’ you mean.”</p>

  added Bruno.)</p>
  <p>We got up in great haste, and followed the
  children upstairs. No one took the least notice
  of <i>me</i>, but I wasn’t at all surprised at this, as I
  had long realised that I was quite invisible to
  them all—even to Sylvie and Bruno.</p>
  <p>All along the gallery, that led to the Prince’s
  apartment, an excited crowd was surging to and
  fro, and the Babel of voices was deafening:
  against the door of the room three strong men
  were leaning, vainly trying to shut it—for some
  great animal inside was constantly bursting it
  half open, and we had a glimpse, before the men
  could push it back again, of the head of a furious
  wild beast, with great fiery eyes and gnashing
  teeth. Its voice was a sort of mixture—there
  was the roaring of a lion, and the bellowing of a
  bull, and now and then a scream like a gigantic
  parrot. “There is no judging by the voice!”
  the Professor cried in great excitement. “What
  is it?” he shouted to the men at the door.
  <span class="pb" id="Page_390">390</span>
  And a general chorus of voices answered him
  “Porcupine! Prince Uggug has turned into
  a Porcupine!”</p>
  <p>“A new Specimen!” exclaimed the delighted
  Professor. “Pray let me go in. It should be
  labeled at once!”</p>
  <p>But the strong men only pushed him back.
  “Label it, indeed! Do you want to be eaten
  up?” they cried.</p>
  <p>“Never mind about Specimens, Professor!”
  said the Emperor, pushing his way through the
  crowd. “Tell us how to keep him safe!”</p>
  <p>“A large cage!” the Professor promptly replied.
  “Bring a large cage,” he said to the
  people generally, “with strong bars of steel,
  and a portcullis made to go up and down like
  a mouse-trap! Does any one happen to have
  such a thing about him?”</p>
  <p>It didn’t sound a likely sort of thing for any
  one to have about him; however, they brought
  him one directly: curiously enough, there happened
  to be one standing in the gallery.</p>
  <p>“Put it facing the opening of the door, and
  draw up the portcullis!” This was done in a
  moment.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_391">391</div>
  <p>“Blankets now!” cried the Professor. “This
  is a most interesting Experiment!”</p>
  <p>There happened to be a pile of blankets
  close by: and the Professor had hardly said the
  word, when they were all unfolded and held up
  like curtains all around. The Professor rapidly
  arranged them in two rows, so as to make a
  dark passage, leading straight from the door to
  the mouth of the cage.</p>
  <p>“Now fling the door open!” This did not
  need to be done: the three men had only to
  leap out of the way, and the fearful monster
  flung the door open for itself, and, with a yell
  like the whistle of a steam-engine, rushed into
  the cage.</p>
  <p>“Down with the portcullis!” No sooner
  said than done: and all breathed freely once
  more, on seeing the Porcupine safely caged.</p>
  <p>The Professor rubbed his hands in childish
  delight. “The Experiment has succeeded!” he
  proclaimed. “All that is needed now is to
  feed it three times a day, on chopped carrots
  and——.”</p>
  <p>“Never mind about its food, just now!”
  the Emperor interrupted. “Let us return to
  <span class="pb" id="Page_392">392</span>
  the Banquet. Brother, will you lead the way?”
  And the old man, attended by his children,
  headed the procession down stairs. “See the
  fate of a loveless life!” he said to Bruno, as
  they returned to their places. To which
  Bruno made reply, “I always loved Sylvie,
  so I’ll never get prickly like that!”</p>
  <p>“He <i>is</i> prickly, certainly,” said the Professor,
  who had caught the last words, “but we must
  remember that, however porcupiny, he is royal
  still! After this feast is over, I’m going to
  take a little present to Prince Uggug—just
  to soothe him, you know: it isn’t pleasant
  living in a cage.”</p>
  <p>“What’ll you give him for a birthday-present?”
  Bruno enquired.</p>
  <p>“A small saucer of chopped carrots,” replied
  the Professor. “In giving birthday-presents,
  <i>my</i> motto is—cheapness! I should think I
  save forty pounds a year by giving—oh, <i>what</i>
  a twinge of pain!”</p>
  <p>“What is it?” said Sylvie anxiously.</p>
  <p>“My old enemy!” groaned the Professor.
  “Lumbago—rheumatism—that sort of thing.
  I think I’ll go and lie down a bit.” And he
  <span class="pb" id="Page_393">393</span>
  hobbled out of the Saloon, watched by the
  pitying eyes of the two children.</p>
  <p>“He’ll be better soon!” the Elfin-King said
  cheerily. “Brother!” turning to the Emperor,
  “I have some business to arrange with you
  to-night. The Empress will take care of the
  children.” And the two Brothers went away
  together, arm-in-arm.</p>
  <p>The Empress found the children rather sad
  company. They could talk of nothing but
  “the dear Professor,” and “what a pity he’s
  so ill!”, till at last she made the welcome
  proposal “Let’s go and see him!”</p>
  <p>The children eagerly grasped the hands she
  offered them: and we went off to the Professor’s
  study, and found him lying on the sofa,
  covered up with blankets, and reading a little
  manuscript-book. “Notes on Vol. Three!” he
  murmured, looking up at us. And there, on a
  table near him, lay the book he was seeking
  when first I saw him.</p>
  <p>“And how are you now, Professor?” the
  Empress asked, bending over the invalid.</p>
  <p>The Professor looked up, and smiled feebly.
  “As devoted to your Imperial Highness as
  <span class="pb" id="Page_394">394</span>
  ever!” he said in a weak voice. “All of me,
  that is not Lumbago, is Loyalty!”</p>
  <p>“A sweet sentiment!” the Empress exclaimed
  with tears in her eyes. “You seldom
  hear anything so beautiful as that—even in
  a Valentine!”</p>
  <p>“We must take you to stay at the seaside,”
  Sylvie said, tenderly. “It’ll do you ever so
  much good! And the Sea’s so grand!”</p>
  <p>“But a Mountain’s grander!” said Bruno.</p>
  <p>“What is there grand about the Sea?” said
  the Professor. “Why, you could put it all
  into a teacup!”</p>
  <p>“<i>Some</i> of it,” Sylvie corrected him.</p>
  <p>“Well, you’d only want a certain number
  of tea-cups to hold it <i>all</i>. And <i>then</i> where’s
  the grandeur? Then as to a Mountain—why,
  you could carry it all away in a wheel-barrow,
  in a certain number of years!”</p>
  <p>“It wouldn’t look grand—the bits of it in
  the wheel-barrow,” Sylvie candidly admitted.</p>
  <p>“But when oo put it together again——”
  Bruno began.</p>
  <p>“When you’re older,” said the Professor,
  “you’ll know that you <i>ca’n’t</i> put Mountains
  <span class="pb" id="Page_395">395</span>
  together again so easily! One lives and one
  learns, you know!”</p>
  <p>“But it needn’t be the <i>same</i> one, need it?”
  said Bruno. “Won’t it do, if <i>I</i> live, and if
  <i>Sylvie</i> learns?”</p>
  <p>“I <i>ca’n’t</i> learn without living!” said Sylvie.</p>
  <p>“But I <i>can</i> live without learning!” Bruno
  retorted. “Oo just try me!”</p>
  <p>“What I meant, was—” the Professor began,
  looking much puzzled, “—was—that you don’t
  know <i>everything</i>, you know.”</p>
  <p>“But I <i>do</i> know everything I know!” persisted
  the little fellow. “I know ever so many
  things! Everything, ’cept the things I <i>don’t</i>
  know. And Sylvie knows all the rest.”</p>
  <p>The Professor sighed, and gave it up. “Do
  you know what a Boojum is?”</p>
  <p>“<i>I</i> know!” cried Bruno. “It’s the thing
  what wrenches people out of their boots!”</p>
  <p>“He means ‘bootjack,’” Sylvie explained
  in a whisper.</p>
  <p>“You ca’n’t wrench people out of <i>boots</i>,” the
  Professor mildly observed.</p>
  <p>Bruno laughed saucily. “Oo <i>can</i>, though!
  Unless they’re <i>welly</i> tight in.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_396">396</div>
  <p>“Once upon a time there was a Boojum——”
  the Professor began, but stopped suddenly.
  “I forget the rest of the Fable,” he said.
  “And there was a lesson to be learned from
  it. I’m afraid I forget <i>that</i>, too.”</p>
  <p>“<i>I’ll</i> tell oo a Fable!” Bruno began in
  a great hurry. “Once there were a Locust,
  and a Magpie, and a Engine-driver. And the
  Lesson is, to learn to get up early——”</p>
  <p>“It isn’t a bit interesting!” Sylvie said contemptuously.
  “You shouldn’t put the Lesson
  so soon.”</p>
  <p>“When did you invent that Fable?” said
  the Professor. “Last week?”</p>
  <p>“No!” said Bruno. “A deal shorter ago
  than that. Guess again!”</p>
  <p>“I ca’n’t guess,” said the Professor. “How
  long ago?”</p>
  <p>“Why, it isn’t invented yet!” Bruno exclaimed
  triumphantly. “But I <i>have</i> invented
  a lovely one! Shall I say it?”</p>
  <p>“If you’ve <i>finished</i> inventing it,” said Sylvie.
  “And let the Lesson be ‘to try again’!”</p>
  <p>“No,” said Bruno with great decision. “The
  Lesson are ‘<i>not</i> to try again’!” “Once there
  <span class="pb" id="Page_397">397</span>
  were a lovely china man, what stood on the
  chimbley-piece. And he stood, and he stood.
  And one day he tumbleded off, and he didn’t
  hurt his self one bit. Only he <i>would</i> try again.
  And the next time he tumbleded off, he hurted
  his self welly much, and breaked off ever so
  much varnish.”</p>
  <p>“But how did he come back on the chimney-piece
  after his first tumble?” said the
  Empress. (It was the first sensible question
  she had asked in all her life.)</p>
  <p>“<i>I</i> put him there!” cried Bruno.</p>
  <p>“Then I’m afraid you know something about
  his tumbling,” said the Professor. “Perhaps
  you pushed him?”</p>
  <p>To which Bruno replied, very seriously,
  “Didn’t pushed him <i>much</i>—he were a <i>lovely</i>
  china man,” he added hastily, evidently very
  anxious to change the subject.</p>
  <p>“Come, my children!” said the Elfin-King,
  who had just entered the room. “We must
  have a little chat together, before you go to
  bed.” And he was leading them away, but
  at the door they let go his hands, and ran back
  again to wish the Professor good night.</p>

  <p class="center small">‘GOOD-NIGHT, PROFESSOR!’</p>
  </div>
  <p>“Good night, Professor, good night!” And
  Bruno solemnly shook hands with the old
  man, who gazed at him with a loving smile,
  while Sylvie bent down to press her sweet lips
  upon his forehead.</p>
  <p>“Good night, little ones!” said the Professor.
  “You may leave me now—to ruminate. I’m
  as jolly as the day is long, except when it’s
  necessary to ruminate on some very difficult
  subject. All of me,” he murmured sleepily
  <span class="pb" id="Page_399">399</span>
  as we left the room, “all of me, that isn’t
  <i>Bonhommie</i>, is Rumination!”</p>
  <p>“<i>What</i> did he say, Bruno?” Sylvie enquired,
  as soon as we were safely out of hearing.</p>
  <p>“I <i>think</i> he said ‘All of me that isn’t Bone-disease
  is Rheumatism.’ Whatever <i>are</i> that
  knocking, Sylvie?”</p>
  <p>Sylvie stopped, and listened anxiously. It
  sounded like some one kicking at a door. “I
  <i>hope</i> it isn’t that Porcupine breaking loose!”
  she exclaimed.</p>
  <p>“Let’s go on!” Bruno said hastily. “There’s
  nuffin to wait for, oo know!“</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_400">400</div>
  <h2 id="c25">CHAPTER XXV
  <br><span class="small">LIFE OUT OF DEATH.</span></h2>
  <p>The sound of kicking, or knocking, grew
  louder every moment: and at last a door opened
  somewhere near us. “Did you say ‘come in!’
  Sir?” my landlady asked timidly.</p>
  <p>“Oh yes, come in!” I replied. “What’s
  the matter?”</p>
  <p>“A note has just been left for you, Sir, by
  the baker’s boy. He said he was passing the
  Hall, and they asked him to come round and
  leave it here.”</p>
  <p>The note contained five words only. “Please
  come at once. Muriel.”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_401">401</div>
  <p>A sudden terror seemed to chill my very
  heart. “The Earl is ill!” I said to myself.
  “Dying, perhaps!” And I hastily prepared
  to leave the house.</p>
  <p>“No bad news, Sir, I hope?” my landlady
  said, as she saw me out. “The boy said as
  some one had arrived unexpectedly——.”</p>
  <p>“I hope that is it!” I said. But my feelings
  were those of fear rather than of hope: though,
  on entering the house, I was somewhat reassured
  by finding luggage lying in the entrance, bearing
  the initials “E. L.”</p>
  <p>“It’s only Eric Lindon after all!” I thought,
  half relieved and half annoyed. “Surely she
  need not have sent for me for <i>that</i>!”</p>
  <p>Lady Muriel met me in the passage. Her
  eyes were gleaming—but it was the excitement
  of joy, rather than of grief. “I have
  a surprise for you!” she whispered.</p>
  <p>“You mean that Eric Lindon is here?” I
  said, vainly trying to disguise the involuntary
  bitterness of my tone. “‘<i>The funeral baked
  meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage-tables</i>,’”
  I could not help repeating to myself.
  How cruelly I was misjudging her!</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_402">402</div>
  <p>“No, no!” she eagerly replied. “At least—Eric
  <i>is</i> here. But——,” her voice quivered,
  “but there is <i>another</i>!”</p>
  <p>No need for further question. I eagerly
  followed her in. There on the bed, he lay—pale
  and worn—the mere shadow of his old
  self—my old friend come back again from
  the dead!</p>
  <p>“Arthur!” I exclaimed. I could not say
  another word.</p>
  <p>“Yes, back again, old boy!” he murmured,
  smiling as I grasped his hand. “<i>He</i>,” indicating
  Eric, who stood near, “saved my life—<i>He</i>
  brought me back. Next to God, we must
  thank <i>him</i>, Muriel, my wife!”</p>
  <p>Silently I shook hands with Eric and with
  the Earl: and with one consent we moved into
  the shaded side of the room, where we could
  talk without disturbing the invalid, who lay,
  silent and happy, holding his wife’s hand in
  his, and watching her with eyes that shone
  with the deep steady light of Love.</p>
  <p>“He has been delirious till to-day,” Eric
  explained in a low voice: “and even to-day he
  has been wandering more than once. But the
  <span class="pb" id="Page_403">403</span>
  sight of <i>her</i> has been new life to him.” And
  then he went on to tell us, in would-be careless
  tones—I knew how he hated any display of
  feeling—how he had insisted on going back to
  the plague-stricken town, to bring away a man
  whom the doctor had abandoned as dying, but
  who <i>might</i>, he fancied, recover if brought to
  the hospital: how he had seen nothing in the
  wasted features to remind him of Arthur, and
  only recognised him when he visited the
  hospital a month after: how the doctor had
  forbidden him to announce the discovery, saying
  that any shock to the over taxed brain
  might kill him at once: how he had staid on at
  the hospital, and nursed the sick man by night
  and day—all this with the studied indifference
  of one who is relating the commonplace acts
  of some chance acquaintance!</p>
  <p>“And this was his <i>rival</i>!” I thought. “The
  man who had won from him the heart of the
  woman he loved!”</p>

  <div class="pb" id="Page_405">405</div>
  <p>“The sun is setting,” said Lady Muriel,
  rising and leading the way to the open window.
  “Just look at the western sky! What lovely
  crimson tints! We shall have a glorious day
  to-morrow——” We had followed her across
  the room, and were standing in a little group,
  talking in low tones in the gathering gloom,
  when we were startled by the voice of the sick
  man, murmuring words too indistinct for the
  ear to catch.</p>
  <p>“He is wandering again,” Lady Muriel
  whispered, and returned to the bedside. We
  drew a little nearer also: but no, this had none
  of the incoherence of delirium. “<i>What reward
  shall I give unto the Lord</i>,” the tremulous lips
  were saying, “<i>for all the benefits that He hath
  done unto me? I will receive the cup of salvation,
  and call—and call</i>——” but here the
  poor weakened memory failed, and the feeble
  voice died into silence.</p>
  <p>His wife knelt down at the bedside, raised
  one of his arms, and drew it across her own,
  fondly kissing the thin white hand that lay
  so listlessly in her loving grasp. It seemed
  to me a good opportunity for stealing away
  without making her go through any form of
  parting: so, nodding to the Earl and Eric, I
  silently left the room. Eric followed me down
  the stairs, and out into the night.</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_406">406</div>
  <p>“Is it Life or Death?” I asked him, as
  soon as we were far enough from the house
  for me to speak in ordinary tones.</p>
  <p>“It is <i>Life</i>!” he replied with eager emphasis.
  “The doctors are quite agreed as to <i>that</i>. All
  he needs now, they say, is rest, and perfect
  quiet, and good nursing. He’s quite sure to
  get rest and quiet, here: and, as for the nursing
  why, I think it’s just <i>possible</i>——” (he tried hard
  to make his trembling voice assume a playful
  tone) “he may even get fairly well nursed, in
  his present quarters!”</p>
  <p>“I’m sure of it!” I said. “Thank you so
  much for coming out to tell me!” And, thinking
  he had now said all he had come to say, I
  held out my hand to bid him good night. He
  grasped it warmly, and added, turning his face
  away as he spoke, “By the way, there is one
  other thing I wanted to say. I thought you’d
  like to know that—that I’m not—not in the
  mind I was in when last we met. It isn’t—that
  I can accept Christian belief—at least,
  not yet. But all this came about so strangely.
  And she had prayed, you know. And I had
  prayed. And—and—” his voice broke, and
  <span class="pb" id="Page_407">407</span>
  I could only just catch the concluding words,
  “<i>there is a God that answers prayer!</i> I know
  it for certain now.” He wrung my hand once
  more, and left me suddenly. Never before had
  I seen him so deeply moved.</p>
  <p>So, in the gathering twilight, I paced slowly
  homewards, in a tumultuous whirl of happy
  thoughts: my heart seemed full, and running
  over, with joy and thankfulness: all that I had
  so fervently longed for, and prayed for, seemed
  now to have come to pass. And, though I reproached
  myself, bitterly, for the unworthy suspicion
  I had for one moment harboured against
  the true-hearted Lady Muriel, I took comfort
  in knowing it had been but a passing thought.</p>
  <p>Not Bruno himself could have mounted the
  stairs with so buoyant a step, as I felt my way
  up in the dark, not pausing to strike a light
  in the entry, as I knew I had left the lamp
  burning in my sitting-room.</p>
  <p>But it was no common <i>lamplight</i> into which
  I now stepped, with a strange, new, dreamy
  sensation of some subtle witchery that had come
  over the place. Light, richer and more golden
  than any lamp could give, flooded the room,
  <span class="pb" id="Page_408">408</span>
  streaming in from a window I had somehow
  never noticed before, and lighting up a group of
  three shadowy figures, that grew momently
  more distinct—a grave old man in royal robes,
  leaning back in an easy chair, and two children,
  a girl and a boy, standing at his side.</p>
  <p>“Have you the Jewel still, my child?” the
  old man was saying.</p>
  <p>“Oh, <i>yes</i>!” Sylvie exclaimed with unusual
  eagerness. “Do you think I’d <i>ever</i> lose it or
  forget it?” She undid the ribbon round her
  neck, as she spoke, and laid the Jewel in her
  father’s hand.</p>
  <p>Bruno looked at it admiringly. “What a
  lovely brightness!” he said. “It’s just like a
  little red star! May I take it in my hand?”</p>
  <p>Sylvie nodded: and Bruno carried it off to
  the window, and held it aloft against the sky,
  whose deepening blue was already spangled
  with stars. Soon he came running back in
  some excitement. “Sylvie! Look here!” he
  cried. “I can see right through it when I hold
  it up to the sky. And it isn’t red a bit: it’s, oh
  such a lovely blue! And the words are all
  different! Do look at it!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_409">409</div>
  <p>Sylvie was quite excited, too, by this time;
  and the two children eagerly held up the Jewel
  to the light, and spelled out the legend between
  them, “<span class="small">ALL WILL LOVE SYLVIE</span>.”</p>
  <div class="img" id="fig46">

  </div>
  <p>“Why, this is the <i>other</i> Jewel!” cried
  Bruno. “Don’t you remember, Sylvie? The
  one you <i>didn’t</i> choose!”</p>
  <p>Sylvie took it from him, with a puzzled look,
  and held it, now up to the light, now down.
  “It’s blue, <i>one</i> way,” she said softly to herself,
  “and it’s red, the <i>other</i> way! Why, I thought
  there were <i>two</i> of them—Father!” she suddenly
  exclaimed, laying the Jewel once more in
  his hand, “I do believe it was the <i>same</i> Jewel
  all the time!”</p>
  <div class="pb" id="Page_410">410</div>
  <p>“Then you choosed it from <i>itself</i>,” Bruno
  thoughtfully remarked. “Father, <i>could</i> Sylvie
  choose a thing from itself?”</p>
  <p>“Yes, my own one,” the old man replied
  to Sylvie, not noticing Bruno’s embarrassing
  question, “it <i>was</i> the same Jewel—but you
  chose quite right.” And he fastened the ribbon
  round her neck again.</p>
  <p>“<span class="small">SYLVIE WILL LOVE ALL—ALL WILL LOVE
  SYLVIE</span>,” Bruno murmured, raising himself on
  tiptoe to kiss the ‘little red star.’ “And, when
  you look <i>at</i> it, it’s red and fierce like the sun—and,
  when you look <i>through</i> it, it’s gentle
  and blue like the sky!”</p>
  <p>“God’s own sky,” Sylvie said, dreamily.</p>
  <p>“God’s own sky,” the little fellow repeated,
  as they stood, lovingly clinging together, and
  looking out into the night. “But oh, Sylvie,
  what makes the sky such a <i>darling</i> blue?”</p>
  <p>Sylvie’s sweet lips shaped themselves to
  reply, but her voice sounded faint and very
  far away. The vision was fast slipping from
  my eager gaze: but it seemed to me, in that
  last bewildering moment, that not Sylvie but
  an angel was looking out through those trustful
  <span class="pb" id="Page_411">411</span>
  brown eyes, and that not Sylvie’s but an angel’s
  voice was whispering</p>
